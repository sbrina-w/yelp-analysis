This is an all-fried food heaven! Don't come here if you are on a diet or not a fan of fried food. However, if your heart and health allows you to treat yourself with a 'lil fried goodies every now and then, Hyon's is the place to go. 

They have a good selection of fried seafood and some fried chicken options (menu pictures posted). Food is made to order and platters are huge!! Also the price point is perfect and the kitchen seems clean! I can't say anything really bad about the place itself as I tried it and loved it. However, as you might notice, the neighborhood could be a little ""sketch"" time to time, which I find totally acceptable as you ll be there for 5 mins picking up your food.

Lastly, I haven't tried it myself but I can definitely see Hyon's as the place to order ""finger food"" for the occasional house party too!!!

Cheesesteaks, fries, onion rings and those damn breaded WINGS! I don't know what they bread them with at all and it annoys me lol kidding. But the wings are so crispy and light ! 

Very clean store and everyone wears gloves. 

Hyon's is small/storefront. Small bench to wait but this place gets crowded and fast. Employees are very friendly and attentive. They know their customer's orders as they walk in the door.

Being from Southwest and hanging in West Philly a lot coming up as a kid, I always use to see this store but never ate from here until recently.

  Tell you this much, the amount of food you receive in a chicken wing special is more than enough for one person in my opinion. Even if you been REAL hungry.

  That special comes with 6wings, golden nicely cooked fries, and your choice is of cole slaw or pasta salad. Think for $11+

  So the prices definitely went up within the last 2yrs. Everything now is though cause of times so nothing big.

  I enjoyed my wings honestly. Didn't finish them but they were satisfying and tasted decent.

  Probably should've skipped on the crab sticks though but that was my fault cause I seen my cousin post some and I thought they would be good as his looked but they were just okay. Should've got the scallops like I originally was gonna do.

  Called my order in ahead of time so it was no long time to get my food.  When you get there if you want condiments, you put them on yourself.

  Everything is there so I put the ketchup, hot sauce, and little salt on both of my food.

  Friendly staff inside. They speak and acknowledge you so that's always points for any business.

  Have no complaints in general and yes I would come back, just would change my 2nd option.

  Hyon's definitely worth a visit if your around the way.",3.666153846153846,2.61,neutral,13

The RIBS have a moist thick meat that do not disappoint on size or flavor combined with the barbecue sauce that rivals some of the best around. It goes perfectly together and the sweetness of the YAMS gives a good offset of sweet with a tiny bit of subtle heat that comes through quite nicely.
My wife got a Ruben that had a flavorful crispy bread, fresh meats and a total package that would give your finest deli a run for its money.

As far as price point it really speaks volumes that you can get a big ass, man sized, watch out now meal, for half the cost I paid for my Chinese the other night regrettably.

Plate 1: fried catfish with black eyed peas and collared greens. Every part of this was spot on.

The BE peas had a savory flavor  and needed nothing... I would crush those on a regular basis. The greens were pretty good and Chef Rich gave me his own concoction of hot vinegar for those interested.

Plate 2: Country Fried Steak (with creamy white gravy) with Mac n cheese and corn. It's nice to finally have CFS or ""Chicken fried steak"" offered from somewhere other than a diner. There are two delicious fried steaks. If you are looking for a hearty filling item, this is it. If you are unsure of what this is, give it a try if you like steak, burgers, fried chicken.... the Mac n cheese was a 3/5 as I thought a little seasoning could bring up to a 4/5. The corn was 3/5 bc it was sweet and simple, but too basic of a side (my fault). Maybe adding a little pepper, or even diced peppers to contrast the sweet corn could spruce it up. 

On another note, this is a great place where you will be supporting the ""Little guy"", the small business owner trying to perfect their craft and provide for the public.

I am so happy to find a restaurant other than Dairy Queen that has white southern gravy. I wish the NE would realize it can be much better than brown gravy all the dang time. One thing I hope the chef adds to the menu is fried okra!

The restaurant is clean and comfy however due to covid it is takeout only. I would call in and ask Chef Rich when to show up. He will even call you back when it is ready if you like.

I will be going back soon for sure",4.279285714285714,4.0,positive,14

Stick to traditional recipes, offer generous helpings and keep price within reason, and it will take off once Covid restrictions are in the rearview. 

If my first exposure to their kitchen is any indication, they are on their way. They need to open their dining room to customers, and the rest is baked in. We ordered their ""Make Your Own"" dinners of 1) Country Fried Steak, roasted carrots & baked beans, and 2) Crab Cakes, bread stuffing, gravy and candied yams; with slice of carrot cake as shared dessert. It was all pretty darned good, except for the carrot cake. Allow me to elaborate. 

The fried steak was a thin prefab ground patty, nicely fried and drowned in that white gravy. Nice texture and taste, with the gravy not too heavy on the tongue. The sides were a well made complement. Same with the crab cake. Crisp edges with crumbly crab with a little breading to bind them together, but with a dominant crustacean taste. We didn't use those little packages or tartar sauce, as there was enough flavor without them. The yams were sweet, but the bread stuffing was a bit dry and was not resuscitated by the gravy. Yet skipping the stuffing left a still very enjoyable meal. 

Word to the wise - Don't over sell a dessert that is past its prime. I was asked if I wanted dessert, and since it was brought to my attention, allowed myself to be upsold because I do love carrot cake as a general proposition. This wayward slice was the exception that proved the rule. It was smallish,  without much cake nor cream cheese icing. It was also noticeably dried out from too much shelf time. Definitely not the place to end a successful meal. It just wasn't worth the calories nor sugar kick. I don't mind being upsold when the product is worthwhile, but when it is a disappointment, it is self defeating. 

Almost lost me there, but decided the rest of the meal was good enough to warrant partially overlooking that mistake.

But I was also ultimately happy because, between the uncanny draw of their special beer releases, and how niche & artsy the overall aspect of their merchandise is, it was something that made a lot of sense for them. Whenever I set foot into Fermenteria or Brew Cafe, I've always been enamored by the unique tshirts, hoodies, and glassware that I saw staring at me from the shelving and rafters. But in the busy restaurant and brewpub setting that almost always managed to become an afterthought for me.

That afterthought didn't happen to me as soon as I walked into the General Store, and came across t-shirts that I contemplated buying for OVER a year, coffee mugs alongside the Awake Minds coffee that Reanimator brews for them, ALL THE ARTISTIC GLASSWARE, and then some. So seeing all of those things brought to the forefront in this setting is obviously what the store is all about, and for that it definitely delivered a win.

If you've read my other reviews, followed my UnTappd checkins, or attended any of the the UYEs that I've hosted (5.0 coming in TBD 2018!), then you may know Tired Hands as a serious beer haven. But, while I may have seen a sampling of it when I looked upon their shelving and beer coolers, I also saw a lot to be desired compared to what I've indulged upon within either of their bars. True this may have been because I was there on Black Friday when every other beer store was winning out on Goose Island Bourbon Barrel Stouts. But still I expected to see more than their their standard beers like Hop Hands and Trendler Alt represented in their cans, and didn't see too many standout bottles this time around.

But still, with an ever changing lineup of forward thinking beers, and their main home brewery just a few blocks away, I expect to see this change upon other visits, and at least walk out with another bad ass t-shirt in the process.",3.9076923076923076,2.83,neutral,13

After having some brews at the Fermentaria, make the three minute or so walk over to the General Store for your merch. The Fermentaria also has beer to go, but in case you forget to get some there, you can always get some here.

It's a small little shop, but it's definitely got more merchandise that I've seen at most other breweries, so there's a good selection for just about anybody. Shirts start at $20, which is about standard for almost brewery, and they aren't the cheap t shirt material either.

Sometimes if they have released some new canned beers, they'll have it in the fridge too, but check out their website to see if they are available in store because they only seem to carry a certain amount and then when it's gone... it's gone until they make more at another time.

After calling it in, I drove there on my way home, and arrived just as it was coming out of the pressure fryer. It looked dark bronze and the odor of the steam being released went right to my head, and made me feel a bit intoxicated. 

Nothing wrong with that!

I watched as the cook removed the chicken and transferred it to an aluminum tray for safe travel. I counted the pieces with him, and think my package carried 17 total. I appreciated the extra generosity. He then wrapped the tray in foil, and tore open the top dome to allow the condensation to escape. In turn, that was placed in a heavy gauge brown paper sack, and again split open at the top for additional moisture release. 

By the time I arrived home, I was nearly overcome by the aroma enveloping the car. I decided to sample a wing while still hot and wait for the family before consuming more. First bite encountered crisp skin, followed by warm white meat and a pleasant clean oil fried chicken flavor. I nibbled and sucked all the meat from them bones, and I selfishly considered grabbing a plump breast for a long moment. 

Nah! It would be more fun to indulge with the fam. So, I waited. 

An hour later we were sitting around the kitchen table with sides of homemade mashed potatoes and green salad as excellent complementary pieces to a very happy meal. 

A star is missing because truth be told, the chicken was a tad overdone. A lighter golden copper finish would have made it perfect. Turns out that as much as I love the color bronze, it is past prime when it comes to fried chicken excellence. Still very good texture and taste, but with a subtle aftertaste that missed the mark.

Save room for dessert,  but with options like Banna Fosters Creme Pie, Bread Pudding, and Chocolate Mousse, it's almost impossible to decide.  It's a casual, family friendly restaurant, open 11am-10pm  Sun-Thurs, 11am-11pm Fri. & Sat (subject to change).
You'll appreciate the large selection of local beers on tap, and their custom mixed cocktails are always on point. My favorite is Debbie's Fruit Punch, you've got to check it out. 
It's seriously good.",3.436923076923077,5.0,positive,13

First the good:  It was super fresh & everyone enjoyed their meals. We had the alligator appetizer, Shrimp Po Boy, Shrimp & Grits, & the Creole Sampler.  No complaints on any of them. We also had the Charbroiled Oysters, Yum!  The bar drinks were also really tasty & strong.

Where the visit fell apart is service.  Our waiter, Dominque , was just plain HORRIBLE!  He took drink orders & appetizer at the same time.  We received the appetizer but no sign of any of the drinks bar or non-bar.  He finally came back with part of the drinks.  I asked about the missing drink which he said was coming.  We then watched him go back over & enter the order.  It then sat & sat on the bar waiting for him to return.
The food runner brought out the order & made sure it was correct.  The waiter finally returned with the bar drink.  All glasses were empty but no refills offered.  I stopped him & asked for additional Dr Pepper & Diet Coke.  They never came.  He likewise did not return until he dropped off the check never asking how things were, desserts, etc.  the buser has came by & cleared all plates, etc.  the buser like the food runner checked on the meal & asked if we'd consider eating there again.

I would still have only taken off 1 star had I not overheard the hostess tell someone who was on waitlist "" people complain about service but they have 10 tables each"". This tells me it isn't an isolated issue. I waited tables for over 8 years.  I understand bad nights but this was just extreme.",3.436923076923077,3.0,neutral,13

I order from here at least twice a week. Every once in awhile my husband and I also get a pizza from there. We mostly always get delivery, and only once have we received a not so great pizza. Little things dont require a complaint, but this did. They made it right immediately and we have not had any further bad pizzas. The delivery drivers are awesome and the staff has always been welcoming. Thanks for upholding standards that so few fast food delivery companies miss...",3.2953333333333332,3.87,neutral,15

I have ordered 2x in 2 months niw- 2 different locations.  I have to say that they have definitely stepped up their game!!  
Omg omg omg!!  The garlic knots are freaking amazing and the cheese pizza is,  too!  
These ingredients are absolutely fresh tasting yumminess with the perfect amount of garlic etc.  I am in pizza Heaven!  And my delivery guy was kind and fantastic too!  5 stars!!!!",3.2953333333333332,4.76,positive,15

There was not one in our previous town, so we looked forward to trying it. Yikes! We can't say this is the worst Papa John's we've ever tried because we have no frame of reference. But, after months of different pizzas, we can say that the pizza coming out of this store is some of the worst in town.
     We tried one about a month ago and it was not good. VERY weak on toppings. Since everyone can have an off day, we decided to try them again. Wow, worse than the previous time - if that's possible. Ordered a pizza with 5 toppings and it looked like a lightly-sauced circle of bread. Unbelievable how weak this pizza was.
     I don't know if this is a quality control issue at this store only or if this is just the kind of product every PJs puts out. Either way, our search continues. We'll never go back to this store (or any other PJ's for that matter).",3.2953333333333332,1.0,negative,15

Ok maybe not... Just a hyped up chain pizza.  It was good for pizza, but there is much better at a Mom and Pop store around.  The jalapeno popper rolls were good keep in mind its cream cheese inside not mozzarella. But they're ok.  I didn't get any of the chicken poppers. Theres 10 in a box so if you don't grab some on the first round here, your out of luck.  The girls said they were tasty with the buffalo sauce and plenty spicy.   As chain pizza goes it was as expected. Staff was friendly and everyone was wearing masks when we entered the store for pick-up.  So that should be peace of mind  for those getting delivery from this store.",3.2953333333333332,2.9800000000000004,neutral,15

Honestly 14 pieces of pizza and maybe a tablespoon of ham and pepperoni on a large pizza. Ordered extra sauce.  It was nonexistent too.  I have ordered from papa.johns for years.  The quality took a real nose dive over the past year.  They are offering a replacement pizza.  Don't think I want a replacement of that.  ID like to give zero stars if that was possible.,3.2953333333333332,1.4100000000000001,negative,15
