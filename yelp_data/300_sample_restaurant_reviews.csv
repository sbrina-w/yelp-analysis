Husband had the jamba sandwich, which is pretty much jambalaya sans rice on a po-boy. For being a little hole-in-the-wall place, it was pretty dynamite.

Circles is in a nice location, but despite being in a old home, it still suffers from inappropriately cold air conditioning, like most Florida establishments in regular buildings.  Also, the house feels downright cavernous and hollow when no one else is there to fill it.  

However, the food was very good (I had the salad special with blue cheese and steak) while my family had salmon burgers (which they seemed to enjoy).  The problem at Circles was the spotty service.  The server brought out our food as it came out of the kitchen, not together, so I had my salad sitting in front of me for quite awhile before the rest of the food came.  That was awkward.

Walked by here several times and finally stopped in to dine on some meat and rice, I  first thought it may be a little pricey but decided to give it a try.

I ordered the Shish Kafta plate which is extra lean beef and ground lamb kebabs, with rice and hummus, onions, tahini sauce and lebanese salad and pickles as garnish.

I was really hungry and not knowing the food portions opted for a regular order of tabbouleh salad which was another 5 bucks.

The food was ready in about 12 minutes, and the extra side salad order took 5 more minutes-so overall very fast. There were no other customers waiting to be served so I was in luck. Two cooks worked in the open kitchen  space and offered me a pita bread to accompany the hummus.

Food quality was very fresh, rice was cooked to perfection and the meat kabobs were tender and just a little pink  in the centre. The hummus was also great, and the lebanese salad was fresh-with a little lemon zest.

There are several single and both 2 and 4 seated tables-plenty for the space they need. This location is still new and was not busy on a Sunday evening-word maybe has not gotten around. You can also  order pop and coffee but I didn't have anything to drink. My total bill was 25.00 with tax and tip-so it was good value for how much food was served. I needed to get a take out tray my most of my side salad and couldn't even finish all the rice.

I like the fact they serve several pickled peppers for some extra heat if you want. This place joins 2 other restaurants like it-and I only wish you could get a beer with your meal. They don't serve alcohol yet, but may very soon. 

They have 2 other locations in Edmonton; downtown and the mayfield common.  I really like their hours because they are open till 2 am Sunday to Thursday and for the weekend crowd they stay open to 4 am. WOW now that's Lebanese!! 

There is a full menu and many other options if you just want single dishes, they are fresh and delicious as promised, and I do like restaurants that keep their promise. Enjoy!",3.5923529411764705,4.59,positive,17

I've had the chicken shish taouk wrap, the chicken shish taouk platter, and the chicken shwarma wrap. All are great, but the chicken shish taouk is outstanding. The chicken so moist and delicious. The only other chicken in the city that compares is the chicken kabob at Sofra.

Have you ever had those pink pickled turnips? There is no other food item this colour aside from candy. They're yum, and the ones at La Shish are the best I've ever had.

Update-November 2014
After my initial review the owner sent me a message apologizing for our experience and asked us to come back to give them another chance as they want to make sure all customers leave happy. 

Upon arrival he asked us what we didn't like about the food and explained that they do have off days and wanted to make up for it. This time we tried the Shish Kafta and the Roasto Panini and they were both delicious! I'm sure he make an extra effort to make sure it was done well which is fine by me. The lamb was mouth watering and cooked just right.

I like to mix the garlic dip into everything, including the salad. It has such an amazing flavour that I likely could have made a review just of the garlic dip, but I'll do you a favour and just tell you to go and try it. I'm also a big fan of their hummus. It's really great to alternate between dipping your pita into the hummus and the garlic dip. (See, there I go again.)

We both had the Caldo de Pollo con Chochoyotes. The woman who waited on us was really nice.  It was ""get your own water, napkins  and utensils"" so we did, and friend also brought the salt and pepper shakers with her to the table.  I teased her about not knowing if she would need them or not. 
When our soup came, on the first taste I was reaching for the salt and pepper.  I haven't salted food in a restaurant in decades but this soup was bland and lacking any flavor.  Once I (and friend) salted the soup twice, and added pepper once, the flavors were there.  We could taste the vegetables in the broth but not chicken.  The chicken (4 small pieces), squash, masa balls (5) and potatoes were few.  The masa balls were very good.  I was expecting to take soup home so I ordered the large bowl. All that was left was about a cup of broth so I didn't bother with taking it home.   For $10, it was not a filling lunch for either of us.
We split a brownie for dessert and it was delicious.  It was soft and chewy on the inside and firm and crunchy on the outside - definitely the best part of the meal.

To start with the positives, Melvicky is fantastic for always being fully stocked with the essentials. In a Fil-Am household that functions on a steady consumption of Datu Puti, Mang Tomas, UFC, and Magnolia, it's always necessary to have a go-to shop nearby to restock on these brands on the regular. Extensive selections abound for noodles, sauces, snacks, and mixes for recipes. Though short of a bigger produce section, the store really does well to carry just about anything a modern Fil-Am would need. Definitely reliable for kitchen basics, the store's wealth of items helps keep culture familiar in our immigrant family's day-to-day.

The ""International"" branding does well to sell the store to a larger audience and avoid being trapped in an exclusively Filipino area niche, but what Melvicky brings in volume of items, it lacks in diversity when pitted against the other Asian markets speckled throughout Reno.

My main qualm is with upkeep. Common threads in earlier reviews here have brought up issues of products that are less than fresh, and that becomes hard to forgive. The store definitely isn't the best at keeping tabs on their inventory, and I've had my fair share of run-ins with aging produce and moldy baked goods -- most of which come outsourced from bakeries a long ways away. It's also questionable to come across a store that takes expiration dates as a very mild suggestion; be wary before grabbing anything that's not apt to survive a nuclear war.

Melvicky is the most convenient option for our Filipino needs by sheer virtue of location, and my family has resigned to shop vigilantly around its shortcomings. Here's to hoping the new year brings better store practices.",2.146666666666667,1.0,negative,15

You order at the stand to the left, and then go find a table while they're making your food. The system is supposed to text you when your food is done, but I don't think it always works.

Plaza Mariachi does it again! The evolution of the Plaza as a community stronghold and incubator for small (minority-owned) businesses is truly remarkable and I enjoy experiencing all the new changes that pop up from here to there. Today's new (to me) change was the inclusion of Taqueria Hidalgo. It replaces... another restaurant property whose name escapes me but I think this one is going to be much more successful.

Why? Because this venture offers something I haven't found anywhere else in Nashville: huaraches. I first 'discovered' huaraches when I lived in Chicago. My assistant and I happened upon a garden-level mom & pop shop on the north side of town serving 'football-shaped Mexican pizzas.' I was hooked. I had two in one setting and vowed to return for more. Then I moved out of the city. Then I moved again. With as many excellent and authentic Mexican eateries as Nashville has, I was a bit surprised to not have seen the legendary huaraches but I let it go. And then I spied this new opening... and peeped the menu. It.was.on.

I made my way to PM to meet a friend for lunch and we went to town. TH is located in the Plaza's central food court. Similar to some of the other eateries, look over the menu in line (there's also a menu board in the back of the restaurant and a visual aid by the register in case you're unfamiliar with the menu items), order at the counter, give your name/number, take a seat, wait to be texted, eat. Simple, right? I ordered a barbacoa huaraches and a chorizo con papas gordita. Oh, and a Sangria Senorial. 

It was all so so good. First thing I noticed was how fresh everything was. Don't be fooled by the lack of visible dirty pots and pans and other homespun kitchen items, this is the real deal. Masa. Proteins. Vegetables. Beans. Crema. My gordita was spilling over with chorizo (deliciously spiced), queso fresco and lettuce. Further inside was pico de gallo and, on top, was just the right amount of crema. It was so much that I ate the majority of it with a knife and fork. At the conclusion of eating the gordita, I thought I may have ordered too much. I was already sorta full! Not one to admit food defeat, I tore in to my huaraches. It wasn't as transcendent as my Chicago original but it was still really darn good. The masa was topped with black beans, plenty of barbacoa, lettuce, crema, pico de gallo, and queso fresco. To that, I added mild tomato sauce and the creamy jalapeno sauce (love that green stuff). Every bite was full of flavor and incredibly filling. My buddy (his first time eating huaraches) was extremely happy with his meal and mentioned that he would return.

Until today, I hadn't been to a Nashville Mexican eatery that served huaraches or gorditas. TH serves both -- well. This one is going in to my rotation. You owe it to yourself to check it out.",2.7657142857142856,3.25,neutral,14

My husband ordered a taco and couple of pupusas. I got two gorditas. Nothing really stood out. The al pastor was wasn't something I would order again. The veggie gordita was okay as well. It was just very underwhelming. I probably wouldn't go again, unless I was in a pinch.",2.7657142857142856,1.4,negative,14

I'm so tired of going to places that charge extra to put that liquid gold all over my food. And then they never put enough on. Not Taqueria Hidalgo. They spoke right to my food soul.

Taqueria Hidalgo is located in Plaza Mariachi. We came here on the 4th of July so it was pretty busy, but not annoyingly busy. There are several options in the food court but as soon as I saw their burrito description, I was hooked. There was a short line but it went pretty quickly. We ordered 2 barbacoa burritos, paid, and then gave them our number so they could text us when the food was ready. We grabbed a seat and enjoyed the entertainment (a live mariachi band). We got a text about 10 minutes later and our burritos were hot and ready. Not a long wait considering it was a holiday. These burritos are a thing of beauty. Queso is poured over top and not in a skimpy way. They also come with some salsas on the side to add a little kick. The barbacoa was juicy and flavorful. The veggies were fresh. It was all the perfect combination of goodness. The burrito was big but I was able to almost finish the whole thing. My boyfriend had to finish the last few bites while I finished licking up the rest of the queso. I was full. I was really full. For the price point and flavor, this place is hard to beat. It would be the perfect place to grab a quick lunch. Or dinner. Or whatever. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's in a ""food court"". It's not your typical noisy dirty mall food court. It's beautiful, clean, and delicious! I can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu...with queso.",2.7657142857142856,3.51,neutral,14

In just one visit, this has become one of my favorite spots in Nashville to visit and take out-of-town guests. The atmosphere was unlike anything I've experienced in Nashville.

For indecisive foodies like me, the culinary options at Plaza Mariachi can be overwhelming when you first visit. I opted for the first place I saw: Taquería Hidalgo (they had me at burrito). And I was not disappointed.

I was in the mood for chicken, so I ordered a pollo taco and a pollo burrito. The burrito was covered in (delicious) queso and was stuffed with black beans, lettuce and pico de gallo. The chicken in both the burrito and the taco was great. I also loved the corn tortilla used in the pollo taco.  I highly recommend trying some of the self-serve crema and hot sauces located where you pick up your order.

The price I paid for the meal was very reasonable and the amount of food was generous to say the least. Although I hope to eventually try all of the eateries at Plaza Mariachi, I'll definitely have to return to Taquería Hidalgo to try more of the menu items.",2.7657142857142856,2.8099999999999996,neutral,14

  Tell you this much, the amount of food you receive in a chicken wing special is more than enough for one person in my opinion. Even if you been REAL hungry.

  That special comes with 6wings, golden nicely cooked fries, and your choice is of cole slaw or pasta salad. Think for $11+

  So the prices definitely went up within the last 2yrs. Everything now is though cause of times so nothing big.

  I enjoyed my wings honestly. Didn't finish them but they were satisfying and tasted decent.

  Probably should've skipped on the crab sticks though but that was my fault cause I seen my cousin post some and I thought they would be good as his looked but they were just okay. Should've got the scallops like I originally was gonna do.

  Called my order in ahead of time so it was no long time to get my food.  When you get there if you want condiments, you put them on yourself.

  Everything is there so I put the ketchup, hot sauce, and little salt on both of my food.

I stopped in this past Monday to get a Flu shot. I didn't have an appointment, and really just picked this one because it was on my way home. 

The wait to get the shot was a beat, but I had no plans afterwards, and knew that they were busy, so I wasn't worried about how long it took.  The pharmacist administered the shot quickly and easily, not much to be stated there.

BUT, it's what he did next that really spoke to me. See, I've gotten vaccinations before, and understand that most places request you hang out for 15-30 minutes after a vaccine is given to make sure you do not experience an adverse reaction. This man started a conversation, about tattoos of all things, because i had several. We chatted for a while, with great conversation, about several topics. 

See, I already knew what he was doing. He was keeping me occupied during the wait time. Most times, I'm asked to sit in a chair in the waiting area and that I can leave after ""X"" amount of minutes. The pharmacist, to keep me from being bored, or to actually chat, or whatever, sat and talked to me during that time. I was very conscious of his actions, and exponentially grateful for that type of professionalism and ""bed-side"" manner. 

Well done with this guy. Don't lose him. He's good people.",2.65,3.75,neutral,15

There are rows upon rows of every kind of alcohol you can think of, and they also have a variety of mixers and gourmet syrups as well. It took my bestie and I at least a half an hour to figure out what we wanted because they had so much to choose from. If you're up for wining and dining they even have a refrigerator towards the front of the store with a selection of plate worthy cheeses.

I don't know, but I'm kicking myself in the ass for casually driving past this place for so many years because it's crazy up in here.  Think of this as a miniature version of Total Wine, but with surprisingly cheaper prices.  Example?  Sure...  How about Jefferson's Ocean Aged Bourbon?  $89 at Total Wine, where I got my bottle, versus $74 here at Lukens.  Yeah man, the joke's on me because I literally drove past here to get to Total Wine.  Won't make that mistake again.

You want beer?  They've got you covered.  I saw everything I like in here, including Coppertail 6-packs, which are relatively new.  But I though of all my favs, and saw them all.

Cigars?  Yup, a whole humidor full.  Not the best selection, but good enough to get someone by in a pinch I suppose.  They do have these little signs up all over the humidor though that read, ""do not touch cigars.""  There were so many that I felt like I was being screamed at, or like I was a 5 year-old in an antique shop being scolded by my Mom before I had even done anything wrong.  Anyone who smokes cigars is going to want to touch them before buying them because you need to gauge how well humidified (or too humidified) they are.  So yeah... Odd, very odd.

It was delicious by itself, but they do give you this sweet and sour type of dipping sauce.  I didn't care for the sauce though.

I got the Hong Kong Beef noodles.  It's flat rice noodles, pan fried (assuming in a wok) with the typical green onions and soy-ish sauce.  It was pretty good for only $12.  Almost anything can be good when you use that much oil and soy sauce though.  I don't think I would trust the pho or sushi here though.  For Chinese food, this place is pretty good.  I haven't been to any other Chinese restaurants in STL yet though, and this was the most Asians I've seen in one place too.  This place is 5-stars compared to Ozzie's next door though.

Pro-tip - talk to the hostesses.  They work, and eat here everyday, so they know what's good.  I'll probably come back here again one more time before I leave STL.",1.57,2.68,neutral,14

My party came here late on Sunday night after an event after pretty much everything downtown was closed. This was our last choice in restaurants inside the casino, but became our only choice after everything else was closed (including the bar, which was interesting). We should have just gone to get fast food or a gas station sandwich, because this experience was horrible.

We were seated right away, and there were only a couple tables taken, and they were all eating already. Despite this, it took several minutes for our server to take our drink order, and even longer to deliver it and take our food order. The food finally arrived, however we got our entrees well before the appetizer. While all of this was going on, other tables were being seated and they weren't be attended to at all. The table behind us waited at least 15 minutes before the server came by for drinks, while the other tables had their server come by much more frequently. Our drinks stayed empty the majority of the time, and the food was just bland and disappointing. The only bright side is the price we paid for the amount of food we got was very reasonable, especially considering we were in a casino. Getting the check and paying was another 15 minute wait. So overall, we spent about 15 minutes eating and well over an hour sitting there. Thankfully our orders were correct, but I can't say the same for others around us.

If your choices are this restaurant and McDonald's, I would give the nod to McDonald's 10 out of 10 times. This was just a horrible experience and not worth the time spent waiting for everything.",1.57,1.0,negative,14

The entrees were a Crunchy Roll and a Spicy Tuna Roll, and I would highly recommend either of these.  We asked for extra eel sauce and extra spicy mayo and took turns dipping each piece into different flavors (soy sauce, spicy mayo, eel sauce).

On a subsequent visit, we had a to-go order.  I had a Combo Fried Rice, which was good, but I was a little disappointed that my container was full of fried rice with a variety of meats (shrimp, BBQ pork, ham, etc.) across the top - as in the rice and meat didn't appear to be stir fried together.

The RIBS have a moist thick meat that do not disappoint on size or flavor combined with the barbecue sauce that rivals some of the best around. It goes perfectly together and the sweetness of the YAMS gives a good offset of sweet with a tiny bit of subtle heat that comes through quite nicely.
My wife got a Ruben that had a flavorful crispy bread, fresh meats and a total package that would give your finest deli a run for its money.

As far as price point it really speaks volumes that you can get a big ass, man sized, watch out now meal, for half the cost I paid for my Chinese the other night regrettably.

Chef Rich knows what he is doing and it is great to see someone trying to bring a different cuisine to the area. I'm so tired of mediocre Chinese and Pizza. Don't be intimidated by Southern Comforts being in an everyday regular shopping center. The food is awesome. I'm from the South and can vouch for what I had at this restaurant. 

Plate 1: fried catfish with black eyed peas and collared greens. Every part of this was spot on. The catfish was huge, nice flaky white meat, and a seasoned light batter crust... not an over-battered, over fried piece of air you will find at other places. The BE peas had a savory flavor  and needed nothing... I would crush those on a regular basis. The greens were pretty good and Chef Rich gave me his own concoction of hot vinegar for those interested.

Plate 2: Country Fried Steak (with creamy white gravy) with Mac n cheese and corn. It's nice to finally have CFS or ""Chicken fried steak"" offered from somewhere other than a diner. There are two delicious fried steaks. If you are looking for a hearty filling item, this is it. If you are unsure of what this is, give it a try if you like steak, burgers, fried chicken.... the Mac n cheese was a 3/5 as I thought a little seasoning could bring up to a 4/5. The corn was 3/5 bc it was sweet and simple, but too basic of a side (my fault). Maybe adding a little pepper, or even diced peppers to contrast the sweet corn could spruce it up. 

On another note, this is a great place where you will be supporting the ""Little guy"", the small business owner trying to perfect their craft and provide for the public.

I am so happy to find a restaurant other than Dairy Queen that has white southern gravy. I wish the NE would realize it can be much better than brown gravy all the dang time. One thing I hope the chef adds to the menu is fried okra!

The restaurant is clean and comfy however due to covid it is takeout only. I would call in and ask Chef Rich when to show up. He will even call you back when it is ready if you like.

Stick to traditional recipes, offer generous helpings and keep price within reason, and it will take off once Covid restrictions are in the rearview. 

If my first exposure to their kitchen is any indication, they are on their way. They need to open their dining room to customers, and the rest is baked in. We ordered their ""Make Your Own"" dinners of 1) Country Fried Steak, roasted carrots & baked beans, and 2) Crab Cakes, bread stuffing, gravy and candied yams; with slice of carrot cake as shared dessert. It was all pretty darned good, except for the carrot cake. Allow me to elaborate. 

The fried steak was a thin prefab ground patty, nicely fried and drowned in that white gravy. Nice texture and taste, with the gravy not too heavy on the tongue. The sides were a well made complement. Same with the crab cake. Crisp edges with crumbly crab with a little breading to bind them together, but with a dominant crustacean taste. We didn't use those little packages or tartar sauce, as there was enough flavor without them. The yams were sweet, but the bread stuffing was a bit dry and was not resuscitated by the gravy. Yet skipping the stuffing left a still very enjoyable meal. 

Word to the wise - Don't over sell a dessert that is past its prime. I was asked if I wanted dessert, and since it was brought to my attention, allowed myself to be upsold because I do love carrot cake as a general proposition. This wayward slice was the exception that proved the rule. It was smallish,  without much cake nor cream cheese icing. It was also noticeably dried out from too much shelf time. Definitely not the place to end a successful meal. It just wasn't worth the calories nor sugar kick. I don't mind being upsold when the product is worthwhile, but when it is a disappointment, it is self defeating. 

Almost lost me there, but decided the rest of the meal was good enough to warrant partially overlooking that mistake.

The whiting had to be smothered with hot sauce to mask the frozen taste. As a lover of whiting and southern cuisine, I was highly disappointed. The two stars are for the candied yams and carrot cake.

It was quite an unwelcoming atmosphere and I swear on my life I am keeping my Manayunk/Roxborough businesses to other places that are not only more welcoming, but also just as good, it not better.

MF and I walk in with Checkers, a caged small mammal.  We're by the door picking out a flavor for the three of us.  So we've decided that Florida key lime was the only one that looked appealing.  Well, the manager approaches us and the very first question she asks was, ""Is that a cat in there?""  So we're standing there thinking to ourselves, ""Oh, is she severely allergic to cats?""

Well, it wasn't a cat.  I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.  If it were a cat, would we have been able to get a bloody key lime cupcake to go without having to be booted out to their stoop?

1. She says it's the Philadelphia Health Department policy.  Fair enough, BUT then why did it matter if it was a cat or not?  It sure as hell was not a service animal.  If the first thing she said was, ""I apologize, but we don't allow animals,"" this place would be okay in my book. Nope, she wanted to know the species first.  So what pissed me off was the way she framed it.   She had a discriminatory tone.  That was the deal breaker.

2.  She says we can wait outside (in the rain) and she'll bring the stuff out to us.  What is this, Lady and the Tramp?  A caged small mammal at outside seating is more sanitary than a dog sitting there with a leash, who is still free to defecate and urinate on the restaurant sidewalk.  

3.  We went to two other food places prior and ordered stuff to go, and no one else had an issue.

I understand that there are federal regulations one must be in compliance with.  It's the way I was approached.  I felt like my baby was bullied.",3.0856250000000003,1.67,negative,16

I'll have to try the gelato another occasion, so I can't judge that.

I had a cream soda cupcake, that was really just a crappy cupcake with cream soda jelly beans on top.  A dry cake with an overly sweet frosting.  Honestly, it was borderline gross.   

There is a much better option for cupcakes and sweets in the area, so I think I'll stick to them.  Plus, the other place does cakes which ndulge does not.  I have family who lives in the area of their other location, and they too complained about the quality of the cupcakes.

I shared with my BF, who thought the vanilla cupcake was delcious, just the type of perfect sweet icing he likes. The cake was good and small bit of pudding good as well. The chocolate ganache frosted cupcake was also yummy. 

The gelatto was good, but not amazing...I think they could improve the texture.

We were completely disappointed! The two female staff that were present were unfriendly and had awkward attitudes which created an extremely uncomfortable environment. One of the female staff did not even address me in conversation and was only speaking to and making eye contact with my husband.

The case had a very small selection of cupcakes that didn't look appealing in terms of display or design. They were sparsely frosted with no special garnishes. We bought four different kinds and they all lacked some sort of quality component. The only thing pistachio about the ""Chocolate Moussetachio"" was the pistachio on top of the cupcake. The other cupcakes were extremely dry and dense and either had sparse filling or were over filled to the point where we had to scoop dollops of filling out.

First off, came in late, just before closing and were still served with a smile!  that goes a long way for me. there were also still a lot of cupcakes available (except chocolate which is apparently really amazing. will have to try next time). 
Amanda helped us, and she was super pleasant and friendly.  If she could get a rating on her own it would be a 5!!! 

now, to the cupcakes!  they were large, and moist, with a LOT of frosting.  the one i had did have some kind of filling (i had PB cup, which is chocolate with PB frosting and a Reese cup on top). i prefer less frosting to cake ratio.  i dont really like eating just frosting and no cake. and it really didnt need the filling for my preference.  The PB frosting was light and fluffy- it may have had a trace of cream cheese which i normally dont like, but i thought it was subtle enough and i enjoyed it. 
The cupcakes are baked in a paper wrap and they reallllly stick to the wrap. i had to eat with a fork (not that bad) but i kept thinking i wish i had more cake and it wasnt all stuck to the wrapper!  flavor overall was delicious, very sweet. 

i also tried the orange spice sorbetto, which was amazing!!! it was a perfect fall flavor, if you are into cold treats in the fall.  

I would go back but i would try the mini cupcakes, hoping that i would have a better cake:frosting ratio.",3.0856250000000003,3.07,neutral,16

1. The hours of operation are impressive for a purveyor of baked goods. I love that I can have a few beers at Lucky's and roll over to *Ndulge around 9 and snag a cupcake to enjoy at home. I do not expect a bakery to be open late under any circumstances so this is a nice perk.
2. The employees are always friendly, effervescent, and greet you promptly. They describe their products well and maintain a pleasant demeanor. I will always give my money to businesses that provide great service. 
3. The dining space is kept clean at all times. Nary a crumb to be seen.

It was about 8:30..

So Lewy's was our third choice and it wasn't very crowded at all. My first impression was the decor made it feel more like a dessert and coffee place than somewhere to go for dinner on a Saturday night. It has an old time soda fountain feel, but with out milkshakes and the soda fountain. It was also decorated with giant glass containers filled with different types of candy. Another touch that made it confusing as to what kind of place this was supposed to be.  Our waitress overheard us making this remark and she told us that the milkshakes next door were to die for and that the staff was always going next door to get them. My thought was that the casino should do some reshuffling of expectations for their dining and put the milkshakes at LN's. 

Anyway, I ordered the From Down the River Po Boy, it was surprisingly good. For only 8 bucks you get a gigantic crab cake with a great rémoulade on a sub sandwich. And I say for only 8 because the crab cake was huge and it was made very well, with real crab and wasn't your typical bread filled pasty mash you find at a lot of places. The rest of my group ordered the chicken cordon bleu, the meatloaf plate and a burger and all were satisfied. They also really liked the potato and leek soup. 

I give this place a three because we got fast service and my crab cake was really good, but the casino needs to rethink what they really want Lewy Nine's to be, a French dessert cafe, a French inspired menu, or an American menu with French sounding dish names. Right now, its a little bit of all three.",2.8658823529411763,2.34,neutral,17

Casinos weird me out so I'm not exactly sure how I wound up at River City, but I was starvin and with friends and we didn't feel like waiting for one of the other restaurants (who all had mondo lines), so we gave Lewy Nine's a shot.

They didn't disappoint. Their food is pretty basic (Caesar Salads, Cajun Pasta, Club Sandwich), but they do basic well. Most importantly, you can eat for around 10 bucks, and that's a huge redeeming factor considering you're in a casino that will inevitably suck money from you. 

This is the type of place where you can tell the employees work really hard to help each other. The hostess was busy so another server seated us. He then introduced us to our actual server. Then another employee refilled our drinks when they saw that they were empty.  That might not seem like a big deal, but servers tend to be really...independent of each other in restaurants so witnessing teamwork was really refreshing.

My order was pretty basic, (Caesar Salad w/blackened chicken) and it as great. I nibbled on my friends food (the cajun pasta & the club) and both were good. I ordered a flavored vodka & club soda, and they used INFUSED vodka (where the fruits been hanging out in the vodka for a really long time) and it was UH MAZ ING. 

I really liked Lewy Nine's because it had a really nice ambiance, good food, a STELLAR staff, and it kind of makes you forget you're in a casino.

And to the guy who said ""You eat dessert with the same fork you used for your entree,"" I'm not sure if you're trying to be facetious or what, but you do realize that this is a diner? If you want high class, don't eat at the restaurant with checkered floors and 7 dollar meals.

Truly symbolic. 

Back in the day, when Lewy Nine's Cafe premiered at the River City Casino, my husband and I raved about their Eggs Benedict. The eggs were poached to perfection, the Canadian bacon hand-carved, the hollandaise creamy. The ""crispy"" hash browns were a heavenly combination of crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. The dish was served hot by friendly, efficient servers, who returned to the table often, offering complimentary refills of coffee and chocolate milk. 

We enjoyed several breakfasts at Lewy Nine's until that one fateful day. My husband and I were en route to our Benedict nirvana and I mentioned in jest, ""You know, one day we are going to go in there and it will all be different."" yiiiiiiiikkkkkkes. Premonition? The power of negative thinking? It is NOT often that I regret something I've said. 

It was all wrong! The Canadian bacon was gone, replaced by six-slices-per-serving pre-packaged ham...three stacked, yet unseparated, slices on each sad muffin. The hollandaise was moderately cold. And those glowing, crispy hash browns had morphed into an entirely different product--a gelatinous mass of potato chunks faintly tasting of bacon? Spam? Something meat-esque anyway. But the menu still said ""crispy"" hash browns...and surely, since they had gone through all the trouble of re-printing the menus with the higher prices, they should have paid more attention to the poor potatoes' descriptors. Had they an accurate editor, the menu would have read ""soggy, fried, rested potatoes.""

We visited the establishment a few more times, thinking, hoping, praying that the proceeds generated from the increased menu prices would fund a revival...a return to the proper portion of pig and such. 

But today (September 12, 2011) my dreams were squelched. On this very day, I endured the most unpleasant dining experience of my entire eating career. 

We had been seated for more than 15 minutes before our order was taken by a frazzled waitress, who apologized profusely for the fact that she was the only server. 

Twenty-five minutes later, we were still waiting for our food. My husband asked to speak with the manager. A pesky young man appeared at our table and explained in a quite condescending manner that the other waitress was pulled to a different area. ""To do what?"", I questioned, intrigued and curious at this point about why a waitress would be taken to a different area, leaving the restaurant customers with such poor service. Was she performing neurosurgery? Perhaps consulting with the House of Representatives about the plan for the economy? I guess I just didn't understand what could be more important to a restaurant than providing its customers with adequate service and/or food.

""To do what?"" ""Something"" replied Mgr. Smartypants in a sing-song manner, with a glimmer of fun in his eyes. No remorse, no attempts at maintaining a professional demeanor, just a few cutesy comments, pleading with us that ""come on, it's not that bad, is it?"" Fortunately, he made his way to the kitchen and I resisted my urge to either put him in a Time Out or beat his backside with a slotted wooden spoon. 

My mind was racing at this point. Where did the other server go? What could possibly be so important that the restaurant at the River City Casino was left with such poor staffing? Alas, the cryptic situation was clarified by a source more reputable than a conference in the Mystery Machine itself. But, of course! The other waitress was pulled away to serve the CEO and the press in the steak restaurant at the other end of the casino! Zoiks! But why wasn't staffing adjusted prior to that day? Is it normal for the CEO and the press to make a surprise visit to the River City Casino at 9:00 a.m. on a Monday morning? Did Mgr. Smartypants drop the ball on scheduling appropriate staff during that shift? Was customer service such a low priority that management decided to just wing it instead of scheduling one additional warm body?

Finally, our food magically appeared before our eyes. My husband ate his overly-cooked steak as I contemplated the mysterious mixture poured over my Eggs Benee. It was either melted butter...or maybe raw egg white mixed with a bit of raw egg yolk...or perhaps the separated upper layer of last week's hollandaise sauce. Unfortunately, I cannot speak to the consistency of the eggs or the origin of the meat, as I was unwilling to delve further underneath the inscrutable sauce.

Clearly, River City Casino has lost our business. As for the CEO and the press, let them eat steak.",2.8658823529411763,1.0,negative,17

The trip before this las one I ordered some kind of beef sandwich. It came with about two inches of gravy which was cooling fast. I dug around for the beef and found when I located it why the huge amount of gravy. I serve better food to my dog than this.  The meat was about 1/8 of an inch thick and all fat and grizzle.  I could not eat it.  

My last trip and it will be my last was Tuesday night.  We had purchased the Living Social coupon.  I ordered the pot roast.  It came Luke Warm!  The menus said it came with Texas toast which I never saw hid nor hair of.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a 3.

We ordered a pizza and a salad.  The phone order took 10+ minutes to complete, and the guy on the phone didn't have the courtesy to put us on hold while talking to other customers.  We were told 10-15 min for delivery.  I would have been happy with a more usual 30 min.  One hour after we'd ordered, the pizza arrived in the hotel lobby, delivered by a dirty-looking guy who may or may not have slept on the street the night before.  The pizza was cold (and foul-tasting to boot), and there was no silverware.  Who delivers cold pizza and thinks you can eat a salad with your bare hands???  I called the restaurant, and the same guy set the phone down while trying to get the manager, whom I could hear in the background saying something about delivering 30+ pizzas that night and there's no way complaining would get our money refunded.  When he finally got on the phone to speak with me directly, he accused me of LYING about being told delivery would take 10-15 min.  He also said that they would not refund any of our money and was really insistent on delivering another pizza even though we didn't want it.  The dirty driver showed up again with another pizza and an insulting amount of plates and silverware...as if a pizza and a salad was meant to feed 30 people.

  My experience here started off good and has been decreasing exponentially upon every visit.  Most recently, I stopped in for a quick one-hour lunch...

  I was greeted by no airconditioning, which (in the summertime), is painful and a hamster-cage-esque stench.  They DID put in enough high-powered fans to blow my check, take-home boxes, and food around, though.

  Our waitress couldn't have been more than 14 years old. The owner clearly hired her daughter so she didn't have to pay her as much for the lunch-time shift.  Still...the girl was very nice and certainly not part of the problem.

  We had about an hour to eat, so ordered a Chef's Salad and Cheese Calzone.  After about 45 minutes, our food was delivered, in which we immediately had to ask for a check and take-out boxes since we had 15 minutes to eat and get back to work.

  Now onto the food.  The Chef's Salad had blatantly stale croutons, water-soaked lettuce, NO CHEESE, and NO EGGS!  Despite the description on the menu, there was no egg in the Chef's Salad (a Chef's Salad staple!)  The portion was obscenely large for a lunch but, I guess, with that complete lack of quality they had to try to make up for it somewhere.

  The cheese calzone was mediocre.  My biggest complaint with that was they changed the recipe, stuffing sauce inside the calzone as opposed to serving it with marinara sauce on the side.

  I would have sent the salad back had it not taken so long to get out the kitchen originally.  We shared the calzone since it was impossible to pick around the stale croutons (and NO EGG!), and tried to scarf it down in 5 minutes before leaving completely disappointed.

  If you go here, you MIGHT get a good meal, but lately there's been a completely offensive lack of quality and quality control in this place.  

  The corners the kitchen cuts to save a few bucks is clearly noticeable in the food.  It's very unfortunate, really, as this place USED to be great...",2.675625,2.0,negative,16

It was drizzling a little and it being monday, a lot of restaurants were closed. So we didn't really have a lot of options. 

Our first clue about the food should have been the number of people in the place. There were about 5 people there.. We decided to give them a chance anyway.

For drinks I got a glass of Stella Artois and my husband got their speciality drink, which is blessed by some voodoo priestess. Both of these things were served in plastic glasses. 

For appetizer, we ordered nachos which were just baked vegetables with chips on the side. They seemed ok at first, but as we started eating, we realized that they didn't have any salsa and the chips were kind of stale. 

For dinner, we got their veggie pizza. The menu raved about their crust. Well, ours was almost uncooked. Pizza sauce lacked flavor. We were hungry so, we ate couple slices each. Our waitress brought out a box for the rest of the pizza and we didn't want to be rude, so we boxed it up and took it with us and gave it to some homeless guy asked us for the pizza. Hopefully he is not cursing at us. 

They also had a live band, and they were OK. No great shakes. They were playing songs I had never heard of. 

Our bill was about $40 and we felt that we wasted our money. Should have just gone to filipe's.",2.675625,1.0,negative,16

LOL So I came to Yelp to make sure I got the word out. 

On July 4, we ordered (for probably the 10th time in the past 6 months) pizza from the French Quarter Pizzeria. We have a condo in the Quarter and we usually order dinner from FQP and breakfast from (temporarily closed) Verti Mart. This particular night fell on the end of Essence, plus it was, of course, the Fourth of July. When I placed the order, I was informed that it would be an hour before we could expect delivery. We were fine with that--understood completely. So we stooped on St. Ann and watched the festivities. 

Two hours later, my husband called in to ask about the order. At first, we were told that the order had been delivered. Of course, we knew this wasn't true, so after some confusion we were told that the order was being sent out again and we were offered a free pizza for being patient. An hour later, we still did not have the order. Now, I don't know about you, but I've never waited in a restaurant for three hours for my food, let alone, a delivery. By now, I was too tired to wait up and my husband and his sister decided to walk somewhere to eat (she's pregnant, so she was REALLY hungry by this time). 

Fast forward to Tuesday morning. I check our bank account, and there's a charge for $38.13. What? So, I contact the bank and they say it's ""pending"" so to give FQP a chance to possibly reject the transaction. Thursday, I see that the transaction has cleared and I call FQP. The gentleman I spoke to was extremely nice. He listened to what I had to say and told me he'd have the manager call me when she returned. Friday afternoon, I finally get a phone call the manager. I thanked her for her call but she was very curt. In fact, she informed me that small business owners have to pay for food that people like me refuse to pay for. Okay, now I'm seeing that this is about to get weird. I was actually shocked because I was fully prepared to have a mutually respectful conversation. 

I tell her that I'm fully aware of what small business owners do, since I was co-owner of a restaurant in Mid-City in the past. I also tell her that I have no idea why she's being rude, how she cannot understand why waiting 3 hours for food is unreasonable and she tells me that I should have called and told them we didn't want the order anymore. I couldn't believe what I was hearing! I mean, they never showed up ANYWAY! Why would we need to call? She also informed me that she attempted to call me several times that night, which is not true and if FQP would like to see my cell phone bill, I will happily provide it. 

Honestly, I have never experienced this before. I managed restaurants in Texas and Louisiana and never did I treat an unhappy customer to a diatribe about how to be a good customer! LOL So, no, we will never order from here again. In addition, I'm contacting the three concierges I know in the FQ to advise them against sending customers their way. Also, I'm letting my FB friends know about this experience. The worst part is, their pizza's not too bad! Their food is certainly a better option than Tropical Isle, but I feel pretty strongly about customer service. To their employees, I would say keep up the good work. You were friendly, helpful, and respectful. To the management, remember that consistency and repeat customers are the key to success in any service establishment. You don't have to like all of your customers but you certainly should show them some respect, especially when they try to show you the same.",2.675625,1.0,negative,16

We saw French Quarter Pizzeria and thought we'd give it a shot. We sat down and were brought menus and had our drink order taken right away. We decided to go with two small Greek salads and a medium four cheese pizza. We waited and waited and after about 45 minutes, still not have our side salads. We should've just gotten up and left after 30 minutes but at that point it was too late to find another place and get back to our conference site in time for the next session. After 55 minutes, we FINALLY got our salad. About 10 minutes later our pizza came. Definitely not the best pizza or Greek salad I've ever had but it was decent. Then again, I was super hungry and probably would've eaten a cardboard box at that point. I don't know if the server was just overwhelmed (there were four other tables) since she was by herself or what but the service was terrible.

The server brought me a large pizza, heaped with 5 toppings. The crust was just the right combination of thick/thin and crisp/soft. The sauce was tangy and spicy enough to compliment the generous amount of cheese and incredibly fresh toppings. This pizza renewed my faith in New Orleans food. 

Downside: It is primarily a bar and a tad smoky. The place was almost empty during the dinner hours, although I suspect it gets packed later at night. They certainly don't advertise their pizza, but they should!

Once introduced to apex java brew there is just no going back to Maxwell House or Folgers. 

There are a number of excellent local roasters that provide the materials to produce this great way to greet the day. Covered Bridge in Feasterville is now one of my favorites. Housed in a rear out building behind an industrial garage, they have established a small shop loaded with all the paraphernalia needed to reproduce your coffee at home, with heavy duty roaster in back that produces enough customized volume to keep their growing list of consumers satisfied within a few days of ordering. In our case, we ordered directly from their website on Friday night and received an email that our beans were ready for pickup Saturday morning. The ""born on"" date stamped on the back of the resealable brown bag was actually the previous Monday.  

That's pretty darn fresh. 

Ordered were Ethiopian Natural Kembata Grade 1 and The Bee's Knees Breakfast Blend (Ethiopia & Brasil). Over years of java drinking I learned that the valleys and mountainsides of Ethiopia grew the best coffee beans on the planet. Mild, yet richly textured taste, I am willing to hunt for and pay more for it, rather than settle for mass produced coffee from Columbia and the like. So, I opened that bag this morning and inhaled deeply. 

Its powerful aroma was overwhelming. 

I waited a moment to let that snort settle in. It was decadent, yet innocent. I decided on a pour over of an individual mug, rather than brewing a full pot. When the filtered water was boiling in the whistle teapot, I began to slowly pour it through the cone filter and grounds sitting in our glass mug top funnel.  

The result was near euphoria. First sip of the jet black suspension was intense, steamy, perfectly delicious coffee, that disclosed its lithe muscular body and subtle undertones of cocoa, strawberry and orange as it played on my tongue. It was as interesting as a fine glass of wine, without the alcohol, but with a similar intoxicating affect.

The gentleman behind the counter grabbed my prescription and said he couldn't fill it, and walked away.  Without giving me a reason or anything.  I had already waited 10 minutes to have him help me and then I had to wait another 5 till he came back and explained to me why he couldn't fill my prescription.
Then on another occasion they were so busy with their 3 customers that they had one of the store clerks back behind the counter helping out.  Only problem was she was even ruder, and I don't think she was even a pharmacist or had any experience.  She grabbed my prescription and said we are all out and walked away.

I went there again and saw her behind the counter and waited for 10 minutes and then just drove off to another location where I was helped in less than 5 minutes.  I called the store manager and complained about it and he apologized but didn't do anything about it.
The straw that broke the camels back was when I went there again and the same gentleman as I talked about earlier in my message assisted me.  He wasn't even busy because there wasn't anyone else there.  I handed him my prescription through the glass window and he looked and said we are all out and walked away again.  Don't know what he was doing back there but it seemed like he was hiding,as I sat there waiting for the very unprofessional pharmacist do his job!!  I drove off and called him and told him that I would never come back and they are the worst pharmacy, definitely the worst Walgreens I have ever been to.

I ordered their BBQ pork flat bread for $8 and my mom had the same since she couldn't decide after 5 minutes of staring at the menu.  I didn't know what I was expecting but I didn't have such great expectations to begin with as to not be so disappointed.  I kind of had a feeling this place wouldn't really impress me that much. When the food came, the lady who brought them over was super friendly and that was nice.  Her upbeat attitude brightened up my day a little.

The BBQ pork flat bread had very little pork, more doughy than anything, a bit of onions and a little bit of barbecue sauce, some cilantro scattered throughout and a bit of cheese.  It really wasn't anything too special and the taste was average at best.  They did have some nice looking pastries and after getting my flat bread, I kind of regretted not ordering a scone (or what looked like a scone) instead.

It's another great lunch venue for downtown folks. The cafe is tucked all the way in the back of the store on the second floor. They often have a menu posting their daily specials outside one of their  entrances, the one closest to the pedway leading to City Centre.

We waited quite awhile for our meals to arrive, almost 40-45 min. We probably should have arrived a bit earlier to beat the lunch time crowd, but it really wasn't that busy when we got there. I think it was because there were only 2 waitresses, and even then it was mostly one doing most of the work. Long waiting times such as this aren't very good downtown when people need to be getting back to their offices.

The food did not disappoint however, when it finally arrived. The salmon wellington was delicious. I'm usually very picky with my salmon, but this one was done just right -- moist, not dry, with just the right soft, flaky texture. My friend had the pea and scallop risotto, which was also quite tasty -- the peas didn't overpower the rest of the dish, and the scallops were cooked to perfection.

The serving portions are smaller though; the cost for each dish is a bit pricey for the amount of food you get. I was able to finish my plate (which is quite rare) and I still wasn't completely full.

So overall, delicious food but slow service and higher than average prices for lunch. But definitely worth a try! Aim to go around 11:30 am or slightly before that if you can. They also have a mouth-watering dessert menu!",2.855,2.23,neutral,16

The glass windows allow for lots of natural sunlight to shine through and the simple decor make you feel like have escaped to relaxation for the hour. I have only ever had their soup and sandwich special. It changes daily. When I ordered it this time, it was the cranberry turkey sandwich together with fish chowder soup. The chowder was excellent. It had lots of great flavours and it wasn't too creamy and rich. The fish didn't overpower the soup either.  My sandwich was ok. I was expecting to have fresh turkey but instead it was processed turkey meat. The cranberries saved the day on this sandwich! It brought out the turkey flavour in the meat and the provolone cheese with greens finished off the sandwich nicely.
The menu is more on the pricey side so I don't venture here often but when I do, it is a little treat. I want to come back and try their famous cobb salad.",2.855,2.9800000000000004,neutral,16

We were greeted by an older gentleman with a delightful English accent, and we had just lovely service here, even though 1) we were dressed like slobs, and 2) we had a (well-behaved) toddler with us (ps - no kids menu but they have high chairs).

My hubby had the truffled poached eggs (with halloumi and truffled hollandaise sauce) which he really enjoyed (and he doesn't typically enjoy brunch), and I had the smoked salmon rosti.  I was expecting more of a shredded potato texture instead of a smoother pancake-like texture.  It was not bad, but I think I would have preferred a more shredded, crunchy rosti.  Portion sizes were decent - definitely not skimpy, but not super-sized.  Prices were on the higher side ($19 and $20 for our dishes), but it's Holt's...

Their Marlton branch has very good pastries and cakes (Their bread is mostly made from cotton bolls, unfortunately.)

Entering the Maple Shade branch, you are hit with two sensory slaps, and not the usual bakery smells of their products. First is a smell of bleach; comforting, if you're worried about the hygiene of the place (It IS clean.), but not what you want to inhale when visiting a bakery. Second is the din from the compressors for the refrigerated cases; the ceiling is low and combined with the hard floors it makes for an uncomfortable atmosphere.

When I visited, early on a Sunday afternoon, the place was almost devoid of pastries, and the ones left and the cookies and regular small cakes were very sad looking and unappetizing. There were expensive, fancy cakes that looked very good, though. There were also boxes of the usual factory-made Italian-type cookies, doughnuts, and some wan soft rolls. Just to try their wares, I grudgingly asked for two not-so-good-looking pastries and two onion-poppy seed rolls. Maybe the girl behind the counter had her brain addled from the vibrations of the compressors, because she put all four items --- oniony rolls and pastries --- in one bag. Oy. Both items, once separated, were okay, just okay.

I think 1 pm is not too late to ask for a good selection of good-looking pastries and cakes on a Sunday. I was very disappointed. This is not the Randolph's I fondly remembered from Marlton. Hopefully the Maple Shade branch will rise to Marlton's standard.",2.0566666666666666,1.1,negative,15

Took one bite of the red velvet, and didn't go back for a second bite, and sadly that's my favorite kind :(. The one surprise was the carrot cake- very good.

The different cookies we tried were all quite hard and stale tasting.

The bigger ""refrigerated"" ones are slightly better, but again the frosting is just too much, too dense, too sweet. And it seems they use that same frosting concoction for birthday cakes.  For my daughter's first birthday, we got a cake and everyone had to leave the frosting to the side.  For the prices they charge, I expect better baked goods.

I love to support local businesses but the quality at this place is just not there.

I'm not really a teriyaki (Yoshinoya..etc) type of person, and I would never actually order teriyaki in Japanese restaurant, but my dad was craving it so we got teriyaki at the Opry Mills Mall.  I was kind of surprised at how much I liked it.

Granted, it was still a bit too salty for my own taste (I generally like things milder), my brother and my dad loved it!!! We ordered Chicken Teriyaki with the chow mein-type noodles, and also a Beef teriyaki with fried rice.  You would expect it to taste exactly the same except with different meats and different carbs... but the beef DOMINATED the chicken by far.  The beef sauce is a little bit sweeter and has a little bit more depth than the chicken sauce did. And it went perfectly with the rice because it soaked up all the sauce, which gave it more flavor.  On top of that, the beef comes with broccoli too!  The noodles ended up just tasting greasy.  The chicken itself was very good.  You can taste that they cook the meat first, then add in sauce, because you can taste the flavor of the sauce, without it being overpowering, and you can still get the crisp of the light char on the chicken. 

Each of the bowls came with cabbage and carrots to balance out the salty---good choice.

I ordered Teryaki Beef with rice and vegatables, with 1 egg roll. At the register I was asked if I wanted anything to drink. I said I'd like a cup of water. In the past I've been given one without a problem.

Man who said he was the manager is featured center, orange and black outfit. Claimed there were no water cups, then after being asked a 5th time and holding up the line, he revealed a cabinet full of water cups. Avoid Maki of Japans at Opry Mills. 
Man who said he was the manager is featured center, orange and black outfit. Claimed there were no water cups, then after being asked a 5th time and holding up the line, he revealed a cabinet full of water cups. Avoid Maki of Japans at Opry Mills.

This time however I was told they were out of water cups. I asked 4x about it and they said they were out - so I asked about water in a regular cup and they wanted to charge me .75 cents, stating he had to charge me because the CUPS cost THEM .75 cents. I would dispute that. I do not believe that is a true statement however I cannot prove that one. Ecocups sells fast food drink cups at rate of .15 cents per cup.  I do not know what the Maki Franchise cost is for cup so I can't say .75 cents a cup is a lie but it sure does not seem to be a true statement or I should sell them cups myself.

I declined and asked again - this time for a manager - the guy SERVING said HE was the manager and said there were no cups. I asked if he was sure and held up the rest of the line - at which time he THEN signaled the cashier to open the cabinet below the fountain and there were SLEEVES of water cups. Lots of them.

He poured me a cup of water then charged me 27 cents. So essentially the manager on duty lied about 5 times on whether they had the cups of water (they are the same cups they've given me before for water).

Maki of Japan, when asked, did not tell the truth about having water cups. Now if we ask if their meat is made of 'cat' and they say 'no', do we believe them?
Maki of Japan, when asked, did not tell the truth about having water cups. Now if we ask if their meat is made of 'cat' and they say 'no', do we believe them?

So if I asked this same manager if the meat they use is ""cat"" and he says ""no"", do I believe that the meat at Maki of Japan is ""cat"" ??? Because he said ""no"" that he had no water cups, and only after asking 5x did he instruct his employee to open the cabinet and revealed that there were several sleeves of water cups I may doubt any answer he gives.

 

This occured at 6pm on 10/19/2013. I was severely mistreated, the truth was withheld from me, and at the end of the day, this is not Nashville's best foot forward for tourists. If I were a tourist, I never come back to Nashville - this kind of lying would turn me off to Nashville, spending my money here, or it's hospitality - which I would consider as phony as the answer Maki of Japan gave me on having water cups. Now Maki of Japan, is your meat made of ""Cat""? You can say ""no"" but how can I believe you now?

This mall is filled with the usual chain food choices and Maki stood out as being a little different. In short, I enjoyed my meal in the Asian style and recommend Maki for people who like Asian food and are pretty hungry...because the portion was quite large.

I had the BBQ chicken plate, and in place of rice, I had the Garlic Potatoes. Which are incredibly garlicky, incredibly salty, and altogether tasty.

And with any plate, you may add a number of sides. I went with broccoli and green beans, but you could also go with kimchee, pasta salad, noodles, and a number of other sides.

The chicken itself was tender and tasty - largely because Koryo opts for thighs instead of breasts.

I also liked my side of broccoli, which had an unexpected grilled flavour.

I just wish I didn't feel so gross afterward. Using an analogy, Koryo is to Korean Barbecue as Wendy's is to Hamburgers - tasty, fast, but not very healthy and doesn't make me feel all that great.",3.3376923076923077,2.21,neutral,13

The last time I went, I had a BBQ chicken sandwich while my wife had the beef short ribs. 

Both were pretty good. The chicken sandwich had coleslaw on it, which was unique and offered a nice crunch to it. The chicken was fresh and grilled in front of me and was both tasty and juicy. All in all, it was a better chicken sandwich than you would find at most fast food places. The only thing that disappointed were the fries - they were frozen (not fresh) and dropped on top of a styrofoam plate right out of the fryer - so half of them melted into the plate! Yuck!

The short ribs are marinated and then BBQ'ed fresh. They were amazing and by far the best item on the menu! You get a couple sides - your choice of steamed rice, potatoes or fries, a couple different types of veggies or kim chi. It was delicious and a good deal to boot.

I love the beef because it's how my mom makes BBQ shish kabobs every summer as long as I can remember. My only gripe is the choices of sides. It's mostly vegetables, and the odd ""pasta"", glass noodles, garlic potatoes, tofu and steamed egg. They're a lot of meh to me. I'm just not a veggie eater. But the garlic potatoes are chunks of potato - deep-fried and then basically what tastes just like honey garlic sauce all over em. 

They give a LOT of food for you, where you can never finish it all in one sitting, and even the price is a tad more expensive for ""fast food"", it's worth it for the flavour and quantity. I like that on Thursdays you get a free drink (where you usually pay for it-which usually sucks, but not on Thursday lol!).

Now I normally don't even write reviews but this has been bothering me and not only do customers deserve to know how rude and disrespectful the employees are at this establishment, but I hope management or corporate will see this so that they know what's going on in their business and that it's NOT okay and maybe they will make a change for the better, and hire more respectful employees.

My boyfriend and I came here for a quick bite to eat around 5 or 6 PM, he loves BK but I honestly don't eat there they often at all. We were at the counter looking up at the menus figuring out what we wanted (mind you there was almost no one in the place,) when one of the workers asked me what I wanted, now I did not hear the woman because she was mumbling and I was still trying to figure out what I wanted, so I didn't respond, and then she turns to my boyfriend and rudely says, ""What? She don't speak?"" Then walked away. Now I did not hear any of this, and when she walked away my boyfriend then informed me what she said. When she came back she was rushing us saying ""Um can you guys tell me what you want cause I have a lot to do?"" (meanwhile the place isn't busy AT ALL and there's NO ONE behind us so it wasn't like we were bothering ANYONE by standing there looking at the menus.) She then comes back asks what we want, and then we tell her that we wanted a small cheeseburger and a chicken fry meal, and then she looked at us like we had 10 heads IGNORED us completely then walked away. We tried getting her attention again, or anyone's attention really for the next 10 minutes but was literally ignored by EVERYONE. My boyfriend then said to them that he doesn't want to eat there anymore because of how we were treated and then the woman rolled her eyes at us as we walked out. 

This experience honestly disgusted me completely, and I wish I knew the woman's name that mistreated us because she deserves to lose her job.

Because they did not have an awning or something to block the rain from coming down, I could BARELY hear the drive-thru operator through the speaker. I was straining super hard to hear (and my fiance is almost deaf in one ear so he DEFINITELY could not hear). 

We ordered the pretzel burger sandwich, 4 count of chicken nuggets with honey mustard, a medium Sprite, large fries, medium Diet Pepsi, 8 count of mozzarella sticks, and an order of chicken fries with barbecue sauce.

I see chicken tenders on the menu which is what my fiance wanted to order (although it said 2 count of chicken tenders but he wanted four) and the drive-thru operator said ""Do you mean the nuggets? We don't have chicken tenders"". And we were like ""...No... the tenders..."" and again she said that they didn't have those, so I was confused about that.

As for the parking lot: Once you collect your food from the drive-thru window, they only have parking spots available for handicap people to park, and you're only able to turn right out of the lot. If you wanted to eat in the parking lot, you'd have to basically do a square around the corner to come back into their parking lot again.

As for the food: My fiance liked the pretzel sandwich. They unfortunately did not give him any honey mustard like what he wanted for the chicken nuggets (so he ate those plain). I was pleasantly surprised to see how big a medium drink is (it's definitely like a large in my eyes!) I'm so used to diet drinks that it should taste fairly normal, but my Diet Pepsi tasted different this time, and not in a good way, I don't know... They forgot to give us marinara sauce (which is pictured in the promo for the sticks), so we ate them plain.

It's the new hot thing for Mexican cuisine in our area. So, I checked DoorDash for the closest place to me that had it and Asadero los tios came up. I put in an order for birria tacos (a bit pricey, double what they charge for regular tacos), beef pastelillos, churros, and Mexican Coca-Cola (another popular trend in the food scene). The birria tacos are absolutely delicious. They essentially make a beef stew with shredded roast beef and pick out the meat and make beef and cheese quesadilla on corn tortillas but leave it uncut to eat like a taco. The order comes with a cup of the birria soup which you can use as a dip. The tacos alone taste very good, the meat is tender and flavorful and you can't go wrong with melted cheese and toasted tortilla. There was so much meat, it was falling out of the edges which was fine because I have no problem picking up the pieces and eating them too. The beef is a little dry but once you dip it into that flavorful soup, it's amazing. Fair warning: it's a little messy when you bite into your wet taco and soup gushes all over the place but the flavor is so good, you grin and bear it. The pastelillos are almost as good as the tacos. Described as a fried turnover, I would call it a fried taco enclosed in a soft, chewy dough pocket. Like a cross between an empanada and an egg roll. The meat filling is absolutely delicious. My only complaint is that I picked up three and the second one was packed with meat but the other two were only half full. Churros are also incredible. Perfectly cooked, a lot of restaurants tend to overcook them and make them hard but Asadero's churros are pillowy soft like clouds who don't skimp on the cinnamon sugar. Every bite was amazing. I've heard people tout the superiority of Mexican Coca-Cola to its American cousin because Mexico stills uses cane sugar but, honestly, I didn't taste much of a difference. I think next time I order from here (because there will definitely be a next time), I'll get one of their Jarritos instead. I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars because this food is only a few nitpicks shy of perfection.",3.948,3.54,neutral,15

I've been frequenting it once a year for about four years now and it always delivers with aplomb what it advertises: boiled shrimp, fried seafood, and Greek salad.

The boiled shrimp are a classic Southern-infused-with-Greek kind of thing: dumped in a pot with a bunch of herbs and served to you shel on, steaming hot. I eat them with the shells on since I am a heathen, but you are of course invited to shuck them. They're always pretty good, if occasionally vaguely mushy.

The seafood options here (and really, why would you order anything land bases unless you are desperate) are pretty dependable. I've had everything from the soft shell crab sandwich (good although I'd bet money it wasn't fresh) to the broiled grouper (tasty, tender, and slightly expensive - 13.99 since they're getting rare,) to a big old plate of deep fried smelts (tasty, although my tolerance ran out after about five.) My grandfather swears by the deep fried oysters which are ""just like his mother used to make"" - quickly fried with minimal breading, they really are pretty exceptional.

Paul's Greek Salad is a beautiful thing. We always order with a scoop of Greek potato salad right on top (to avoid dilution) and it adds a starchy character to the salad that can't be beat. This is no healthy California salad, but a big oil and herbs and vinegar concotion with good ol' iceberg lettuce, huge hunks of feta, tomato and cucumber, and good old Kalamata olives to accompany. The salads are huge - the serving for one is more then enough for two normal sized human beings. It'll probably kill you, but as the saying goes, you'll die happy.

Decor is classic Florida Nautical (I love it) with the plastic fish and the random ship parts and the big old fish tanks. Service is quick, perky, and Southern friendly, which is always appreciated after any stint in New England (where I live right now.) There's a full bar, so you can sit down, eat some shrimp, and watch the snowbirds get progressively drunker as the afternoon goes by.",3.11,3.34,neutral,15

She then recommended snow crab, saying it was fresh and local. Its not, its from Alaska. We ordered it anyway, and it was bad, and no where near fresh.

Luckily I brought my own bottle of wine, and they didn't know what corkage was, so I got away with it.

I need to clarify something first. That clump of potato salad on the side of the Greek Salad? It's an exclusive Tarpon Springs thing. You don't get that in Greece! ( I lived in Greece for 6 years. It ain't happening!) Secondly, they just took the gator bites appetizer off the menu. Why? I don't know. It was the best grilled gator I've ever tasted. :(

Our server, Christy, put a basket of bread on the table. You have to smell it...warm and a lil bit of Heaven! I always order the Horiatiki Salad (Village Salad) made up of a 3 appropriate slices of feta, some pepperoncini, tomatoes, cucumbers, nice kalamata olives and a light greek dressing...a beautiful thing.  So, because no gator, ( and the only good Gator is on a grill!) this time they offered an escargot stuffed mushroom (6 to an order) for an added special appetizer. Deelish! Our entree was the Grouper, Scallop, Shrimp Special. I ordered it lightly blackened. Most people outside of N'awlins tend to over blacken anything with the spices. This dish was perfectly grilled.

Because we are healthy conscience, we split this entire meal and were quite satisfied. The bad news is that dessert was out of the question. :( I would have tried the Galactoboureko this time. Which brings us to our server, Christy. She was a delight and always makes our experience at Paul's great. She remembered us from our last visit as she was still apologizing for the Baklava which I wasn't happy with.

I've been to many pretentious overpriced seafood snobbery joints!  Paul's is far from that. I feel at home, they are quite consistent in making their food, AND the price is so reasonable for the fresh seafood! Yes, I do know when they get it. Oh, and if you are not satisfied with your service, all you have to do is ask for a manager.

In fact, it strikes me as a fading legend of Tarpon Springs dining. Paul's Shrimp Shop is now overpriced and bad.
My first clue something was amiss was that the place was practically empty on a Saturday night. In fact, we had originally planned to dine at the much better Rusty Bellies but being a holiday weekend, were unwilling to wait upwards of an an hour for a table.
Our waitress, who looked to be about 12, seated us and brought a small basket of somewhat stale country white bread, and then disappeared. After several minutes, she reappeared and took our drink order. We ordered the Peel-and-eat Shrimp and Oysters Rockefeller of which the shrimp were excellent and the oysters were good. She then disappeared inexplicably for I would guess 20 minutes before taking our order. During this time I was unable to get another refill on my drink. I think one of the other waitresses must have said something to her because afterwards her attentiveness improved, albeit not as much as we would have liked.
I ordered one of the specials with what I suspect was NOT Grouper, along with obviously prepackaged and frozen shrimp and scallops. All of which were practically tasteless, for $17. The 'Cole slaw' was nothing more than shredded cabbage mix and a scarce amount of mayonnaise, it had no flavor whatsoever. My wife ordered the fish sandwich which was passable. Our fellow diners ordered a mediocre broiled Grouper and a side of Paul's Potatoes which were somewhat OK, and a horrible grilled chicken which we would have sent back had our waitress been present, but remained uneaten.
Our waitress disappeared again, and was gone for more than 20 minutes. the restaurant was not busy at this time. Our guess was that she was either smoking, or her boyfriend was working there someplace or something.
The bottom line is we were not impressed with either the service or the food. This restaurant looks to be on it's last legs so there's a good chance this review will be moot in a few months anyway. If not it should be. This restaurant is being kept alive by what I call 'The Orlando Effect' which is- Mediocre restaurants near tourist attractions which would otherwise close for lack of patronage from locals who know better are kept open by unwitting visitors who do not.",3.11,1.6800000000000002,negative,15

Then a couple of us had the buffet, which again was plentiful and delicious. All in all - a great meal - and at a very reasonable price.

I stopped by this Northside location tonight to pick up some dinner. When I first walked in, I instantly noticed how clean the place was, and that gave me a good impression right away. There was a big menu conveniently posted on the wall, just as I walked in. The way it works at Pizza 73 is you order a pizza of any size, and you get a second pizza or wing meal for free. I ordered the 12"" Grand Slam and the Vegetarian, and it came out to $24, which really isn't bad. 

They told me it would be about 10 minutes, which is fast, so I sat down in their seating area, while I waited. This was actually kind of nice, because they had these ultra-modern red leather couches, sidetables with magazines to read, and even a gas fireplace. I couldn't keep my eyes off the funky yellow-orange tiles that lined the walls. 

The food was finally ready in about 12 minutes, and I was hoping it would be as impressive as the interior decor. I've had Pizza 73 before, many years ago, and it was good, but not amazing. When I finally got home and started eating, I was totally blown away by how good their pizza was. The crust was cripsy, but not overly greasy. There was just the right amount of cheese and toppings, and the sauce was very mild and fresh-tasting. One complaint I have about the Vegetarian pizza is the fresh slice of tomato they lay on top of every slice--just not my thing. 

Overly, awesome pizza. It's no Funky Pickle, but it's a close second. I'm starting to think that Edmonton-based pizza chains have the best pizza!",1.832,3.18,neutral,15

With two for one pizzas, or a pizza and a chicken wing meal, Pizza 73 has deals that are simply second to none.  You can also get a huge variety of topping cominations, including building your own. 

My favourite is the barbecue chicken - loads of grilled chicken, red onions, and barbecue sauce.  I have had barbecue chicken pizzas in normal restaurants and they have not been as good as here.  Pizza 73 never skimps on toppings, including the cheese.  I am not a cheese person, but for some reason on pizza I enjoy it.

Why haven't my fellow yelpers been stalking this food truck more often?  I've had tacos at all of the taco trucks, and I've gotta be honest, Shell's were my fav.  Of course, I don't eat meat, so that limits my perspective a bit (and I am obsessed with Seoul Taco's Tofu Gogi Bowl...it's a tough one to beat).  But I'm glad that I headed back to Crestwood Court on Saturday to check the veggie tacos out.

I arrived at 3:40, so most of the trucks were finished serving.  But not Shell's.  Score!  I walked up and ordered an order of veggie tacos (2 per order-with grilled peppers, onions, zucchini, and sprinkled with cotija cheese, key lime crema, and your choice of red or green salsa) for 7.50.  They asked me what salsa I wanted, and after inquiring about their spiciness (I don't do spicy), they assured me that neither were hot.  So I picked the green.  I think all of the tacos usually come with black beans and rice, but because of the large event I'm sure, in order to be more efficient, they were serving their sweet potato chips with everything instead.  Fine by me!  I really wanted key lime pie too, but they were out.  Bummer.  They also warned me that they were out of onions before they charged me, and made sure that that was ok.  I do love onions, but I said yes.  However, they must have found some, because my tacos actually had onions in them!  Double score!  And I really appreciated the heads up anyway.  Also, the sweet potato chips were easily the best that I've ever had.  A few were more chewy than crispy, but with their flava, it didn't even matter.  I actually kind of dug it.  And luckily, they gave me A LOT of them too!

I'd love to see them add another vegetarian item, like a sandwich, but I'll definitely be back to try the rice and beans (if they are vegetarian), and for more of those yummy chips.  The service was fast, friendly, and I felt that it was a bit of a better value than some of the other things that I've had (probably because there were so many chips!).

Luckily Shell's Coastal Cuisine is trying to change that.  They currently come out to Chesterfield every Thursday  from 11:15am until ingredients run out. 
  
After driving around for a while (more on that later) I finally found the truck sitting out in the parking lot  of some large office buildings.  I got there around 12:30 and there were a couple customers out there.  I can't resist a Cuban sandwich (ham, roasted pork, swiss cheese, mustard, pickles), so I ordered that ($7.50 tax included), it came with a large amount of sweet potato fries. 
  
It came out about 4-5 minutes later and looked great.  It was done panini style with thin n crispy bread.  It tasted really good  and was nice and easy to eat without getting messy, which is a huge plus for me.  I'll admit I was hoping for a little more assertive flavor.   Maybe offering some kind of spicy mustard would be a good idea.  But it was still very good.  The sweet potato chips were awesome, nice and crispy and salted just right.  
 
Finding the truck was a pain due to Google Maps crappy directions.  The address is 15400 S. Outer Rd.  The best way to get there is to take 64 West to Chesterfield Pkwy East, make a left (so you're going south), go through the first light, at the next light (Schoetter Valley Dr) make a right, then another right into the giant parking lot.  Keep driving down the lot and  eventually you'll see em.  If you keep an eye out you can see them from Chesterfield Pkwy.

After tasting the delicious tacos from other trucks in the area I was very disappointed by Shell's bland offerings.

I ordered two tacos - one fish and one steak with corn tortillas and green salsa - with a side of sweet potato chips and cactus salad. I was excited by the descriptions of everything, since it sounded like there would be a lot of flavor and spiciness you expect from tropical-style food.  First disappointment was that apparently the fish taco takes forever. I appreciate that they make everything to order, but really, when I order food from a food truck one of the basic things I'm looking for is fast service. 

Second disappointment came when I actually got the tacos and tried to eat them. I say ""tried"" because both tortillas around the fish taco fell completely apart after the first bite, and I had to eat the rest of the taco with a fork. The taco itself was shockingly bland. I actually couldn't taste the fish at all. The steak taco fared only marginally better. 

The sweet potato chips were tasty but nothing special. They were also barely seasoned at all, and a few minutes after getting them they were already starting to get soggy. The cactus salad was an interesting idea, but it looked and tasted like pickled green beans.

I'm really not sure where all these stars are coming from. My experience was less than spectacular. I think this food truck has glimmers of potential, but it has a very inconsistent image, which if you really think about it, is kinda ironic and funny because they bill themselves as ""Floribbean"". 

I've been putting off reviewing Shell's because of this, but tonight, I ran across Catherine W's review, and was like, ""Ohmigod, I'm NOT crazy!"". Like Catherine, I tried them for the first time at 4Hands Food Truck Fest, and if you read my truck fest review, yes, we didn't get there until the latter half of the festival. Shell's had run out of more than half of their offerings, including their Cuban (which was my first choice), so my choices were limited, which may have played a part in how they turned out, but I'm not convinced that should be an excuse. 

Prices are pretty reasonable and in the ballpark with other food trucks. You can order a salad for $6.00 or you can go with a sandwich with sweet potato chips or two tacos with two sides for $7.50. They do take credit cards. So after debating my choices since I couldn't get the Cuban, I got into line with three people ahead of me. It took me about ten minutes to get to the head of the line. I ordered fish tacos with flour tortillas, sweet potato chips, and the cactus salad. Once I ordered, it took another 20 minutes to get my food...there were apparently four or five people ahead of me. And yes, I appreciate them cooking it to order, but honestly, I don't know why they do it because by the time I walked back to my table 10 yards away, the fish was lukewarm. Devise a method to cook in batches or something and keep it under a heat lamp or something...because cooking it to order didn't really make much of a difference here. Because not only was the fish taco lukewarm, it was all bland. The description is written as fish, grilled onions, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, cilantro, and key lime crema. Really? Okay. So I remember tasting the fish. And the tomatoes and lettuce. But the onions, cilantro, and key lime crema, while physically there, didn't do anything to the tacos. Actually, I'm pretty surprised that it was key lime crema because there was no key lime taste to the sauce at all. At least my tacos did not fall apart. 

The cactus salad was not what I really expected; I would really have to describe it as sour pickled green beans. Not really my cup of tea. The only redeeming factor in the meal was the sweet potato chips...they are pretty good. 

So, if you read my fest review, I mention that everyone had run out of bottled water by 6 PM, and that it was a food truck that had casually mentioned it. Well, Shell's was the food truck; while I was standing there waiting for my food, she said it to a customer who was inquiring about water. And all I really want to say is that, you had like three people working, and one of the reasons why I wanted to try you guys out is that one of your employees was taking a break at a nearby table and was talking your truck up like it was the best thing in the world. And if your employee has the time to kick it up and if your menu is half gone anyway, with the little business sense I have, wouldn't it make sense to send an employee out on a water run? You would have made a KILLING. Just my two cents.

I feel like I should give Shell's another try, but with the plethora of all the other food trucks out there, it'll be awhile before I do...and honestly, if there are other choices in the area, Shell's wouldn't be my first choice.",2.7342857142857144,1.31,negative,14

I agree with the other Yelper exactly. The menu sounded really good. I ordered the shrimp tacos, with a side of the cactus salad. Let me echo other reviewers by verifying that, like them, my tacos were very bland. Not just that but, there were 3, only 3  small shrimp in each taco.  I frequent a couple of local Mexican grocery stores and I am very familiar with CANNED cactus, which I saw was being described as pickled green beans. This is what is being used in their ""cactus "" salad. Shells, really, canned cactus, yuk! The low quality store bought white corn tortillas also fell completely apart from the wet ingredients in the tacos. The whole plate was really a mess and not tasty. I ate what I could of it and went somewhere else for lunch. We don't like to spend our limited dollars on bad tasting food. If I thought our visit to Shells was just a fluke, I would try them again, but these people know what they are serving. I don't think we will be returning.

I ordered the fish tacos and a side of black beans.  My friend got the chicken taco and a side of guacamole. It was no problem to do 1/2 orders, double orders, different sides.  They really wanted to work with us to make sure we got what we would enjoy.

The sandwich was reasonably priced at $9. I was surprised with sweet potato chips on the side.  The staff was friendly and the service was quick.  The best part was the hot sandwich.

I decided to veer away from my usual vegetarian ways because of this lack of availability and went to Shell's for some fish tacos. 

For $10, I got two grilled fish tacos in a flour tortilla with some shredded lettuce, tomato, pickled red onions and some kind of creamy sauce drizzled on it and a side of sweet potato chips. They offered a good selection of hot sauces and I drizzled Cholula liberally on my tacos. This turned out to be fortunate, as that's about all I tasted on the whole taco. It was just kind of weird. These nice-looking fresh ingredients all together, but no flavor. The fish appeared to be of good quality, nice texture...but it's like they totally forgot to season or marinate them (I asked a co-worker who got the same thing and she concurred). The tacos were sufficient and far from gross and I did eat them both (I did spend $10, after all), but they were so unsatisfying that my first thought was to go get fish tacos from my favorite Mexican restaurant later on tonight for dinner. They just need to marinate that nice fish in a good blend of seasonings before cooking and I know they'd do better business.

The staff was friendly and quick to point out suggestions on the menu. This location is not an identical clone of the other two Yummy House locations, but rather a Cantonese style noodle house that uses a lot of the same sauces and flavors from the other Yummy House locations.  We ordered the Spicy XO Seafood Chow Fun and the Shrimp and Scallop Rice Porridge. The Seafood Chow Fun was very flavorful and I very much enjoyed the thick rice noodles. The Shrimp and Scallop Rice Porridge had a good taste, but is a very delicate dish with subtle  flavors that was easily overpowered by the Chow Fun.  Overall I had a great time, and intend to go back to try other items on the menu.

***Update 7/28***

We have been going to Yummy Noodle house on and off whenever we are in the area. Cindy is correct in that the place is still a hidden little gem. I recently tried their Udon noodles and am in love with them.  

A little tip for those of you that go to the original Yummy House or are interested trying this place. They do not have a beer or wine license, so you cannot purchase any alcoholic drinks there. However both restaurants provide complimentary corking service, so you can bring your own beer and wine and they will chill and pour it for you gratis.",2.674,5.0,positive,15

The Salt & Pepper Calamari was on-par with the original Yummy House. The Szechuan Pork was very tasty as well. The Sweet and Sour Pork was amazing - I wanted to lick the plate. We tried the jellyfish and it reminded me too much of slimey raw octopus (nakji) in South Korea. I'd skip it next time. The Hometown Style Rice Noodles were also underwhelming.

Service was satisfactory - the food came out quickly and there were no issues during our visit except a mishap with counting cash at the end (just separate the checks if you can). The atmosphere is not much different than the original Yummy House. There is nothing fancy about it and the parking lot honestly made me fear a little for my car and safety.

It is not a bad alternative if you get stuck with a wait at the original Yummy House, but they need to transfer the Crab Meat Fish Maw Soup and Dried Grape Duck Fried Rice over to this location for me to be a regular here.

Made reservations for two this past Thursday; arrived and the reservations were definitely not needed, but I'm glad to make them anyway. 

Hostess seated us: ambiance left much to be desired, almost cafeteria like with cheesy décor. Thought this was an expensive steak house? Oh, it gets better!

Waitress arrives empty handed after about 10 minutes (where's the water!) and asks if we'd decided on a wine. We had, so we ordered a bottle of Newton. I had to ask her to bring water. 

The wobbly cafeteria table finally got to us, so we propped a menu under to stop our silverware from falling. Thank goodness our water hadn't arrived yet, else it would be everywhere. 

Finally, she brings the wine...still no water....opens it, pours and leaves, promising to be right back with water. Well, we realize she's brought the wrong bottle, the more expensive blend of Newton, and my dining guest assures me it's not a big deal. Mr. Shula would be horrified I presume. 

She comes back (with water, yay!) and takes our order. Ordering the NY Strip, The Surf & Turf, both medium rare-minus, we come to another painstaking moment. Medium rare minus? She asks, with what I sense to be a bit of attitude. Yes dear, the chef will know. Good lord, is this a steak house? No, it is not. Two wedge salads are ordered as well, along with a few sides. Crossing our fingers. No bread is ever offered or brought. 

Wedges arrive, and although I've had better at Sullivan's, they are good and I am hungry! Halfway through my salad, fork still in hand, mouth still moving, she asks if I'm done (Really? There's dressing dripping from my lips!). Well, she asks, your steaks are up, so would you like me to bring them or leave them in the back until you're finished. 

Appalling! Why had she fired them? Mr. Shula, you really need to re-think your training program. 

Steaks themselves were delicious, cooked perfectly at a medium-rare-minus, full of flavor. Sides of asparagus were a tad limp, overcooked, but the meat helped. 

If you're looking for a good steak, Sullivan's has not only delicious meat, but when you spend over $200 on dinner, you're not left wondering, FOR WHAT!? Will never be dinning here again.",1.7149999999999999,1.0,negative,16

1, The bar area is a disaster. It's a comedy routine watching this staff struggle to work. Whatever could happen did during my 4-day stay at the Marriott. It became a nightly routine watching this crew struggle to get through a night. We had everything from rude service, bad drinks, dirty glasses, drinks made incorrectly, refusing to serve food, etc.

2. The one time we were served food (first, we had to find a waitress. The bartenders refused our food order.) The food was delicious! We ordered nearly every appetizer and  loved each and everyone one. The shrimp - amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the spinach dip but my coworkers loved it. The calamari was unique and tasty, etc.

But I do hope they address the bar situation before I make a return visit to the Philadelphia Marriott West. Initially amusing, this comedy routine lost its appeal after one too many mishaps. 

Oh, and how do you stop serving food before 11 p.m. on a super busy Friday night!?!?!",1.7149999999999999,1.8899999999999997,negative,16

Seriously, you've got to be an egomaniac to claim the best steak money can buy and put that crap on a plate.  Suggest they switch from Undefeated to Uninspired.

I started with a seared Ahi appetizer.  The fish was pretty good and prepared the way I would have expected.  It was served with a tub of white sauce that was their take on a wasabi.  It was horseradish and sour cream.  Bleh - and enough to cover 22 portions.

For dinner I ordered the fillet.  Now, I generally like my fillet medium rare and admit that I'm a total pain in the ass if it's not prepared correctly.  But since you're charging me $36 for an 8oz portion, I'm expecting perfection.  After discussing my concerns with the server she suggested I order rare as they tend to go over done.  Seriously?  You're exposing your kitchen's inability to properly cook a steak to the customer.  Let's guess how it came out....  drum role please.... medium rare!

The steak was completely uninspired.  If you're telling me that this is the best steak that money can buy, I say your a damn liar.  I could have gone to the local Genaurdi's and picked through the select fillets and come up with something better.  In my best Lloyd Bentsen, ""I know Prime Fillet and you Senator are no Prime Fillet"".

Sides of asparagus and local veggies were ordinary and uninspired.  On a good note, the Bookers that I ordered straight up was perfectly poured into the glass.

I work in the mall, so when I want a sweet treat, cookies sometimes are the fix. The issue with this place is that there is usually 1 (very slow) employee working at a time. This partially because the business is being cheap and not having 2 people working.

On top of the extremely slow service, the cookies are almost always too brown, on the verge of being crispy, which no one wants! I went today to get some cookies for my team, and the cookies didn't even look edible. I ended up just buying one to curb my sweet tooth, and then it was just as horrible as it looked.

I've never eaten there, though, so upon moving to downtown, I realized I had a lot of ground to cover.

The mall is full of chain spots (as predictable). What caught my eye, however, was a Nestle TollHouse/Edy's kiosk - probably the only one in Indiana! Sparse during COVID, but with a pastry case stocked with cookies of all sorts, cookie cake slices, and an impressive ice cream array of 14 flavors, I saw promise. 

I'd been hankering a cookie cake craving and decided to give into their slice-drink combo of $4. What greeted me was an adorable, snowman-decorated slice that was, frankly, HUGE. Coated in all sorts of icing, I was impressed.

It's good cookie cake, I won't lie, although I sorely missed that familiar grocery store cookie cake taste. The icing, as promised by the boy who sold me the slice, is pretty fabulous. However, as someone who doesn't really love milk chocolate, the slice was a little too chocolate-studded for me.

Sadly, this one doesn't measure up for me.  First, there is really no ""ambience"" in the restaurant, no warmth, almost utilitiarian.  There is a bar when you walk in, it almost looks like it's not ""open"" as you really have to look hard to see bottles, beer taps, etc.  We though perhaps they didn't have their liquor license because no one was sitting there and it looked empty.  Turns out not to be the case, as there were some folks at the bar when we left, and drinks we on the menu.    Bar offerings were meh, not enough wines and the beer selection is nothing to get excited about.  Parking was a nightmare, even on a weeknight, even with the dedicated parking lot they apparently share with McGerk's.  Drove around and around until someone finally pulled out and we pulled in.  I had the Margueritta pizza, which was just OK, on the smallish side and quite expensive for a 12"" pie.  Crust was thin, but doughy.  Weird.

From what I see, this means that they now have hot carved meats under lamps carved to order to put on your salads.  The previous menu remains, but these new Carvery choices are on top of it.  

At least right now, this seems to have confused the staff.  As I waited in line, I can tell you that the poor young man that waited on me had a confused deer in the headlights look as he had to go back and check the list of ingredients in my salad at least three times.  He may have been a trainee.  I actually felt bad for the guy.  I swear he looked nervous as he made my order.

Also, the manager was watching the line, and at least twice as I was there, he felt he had to crack the whip by cajoling the workers to work a bit faster to take care of us.  They're still getting used to a lot of new things here.  I can tell that.  Perhaps they will improve this.  

So the Carvery salad options are now $11.  So for me, getting a medium soup, a cookie, a full salad with fresh carved hot chicken, and a bottle of water now runs close to $20.  I'm sorry, but this pricing will not bring me back often.  

But, overall food quality was good.  Everything tasted fine, and the hot carved options beat the old cold options anytime.  That is worth the three stars alone.  

But if I'm going to spend $20 on lunch, first off it's not going to involve salad, and it certainly won't involve a chain.  I can get this quality of food in my own workplace cafeteria for half the price.",2.6386666666666665,2.31,neutral,15

First off - I'm disappointed that I hadn't left a previous review because until this week I was a big fan of Saladworks in general - particularly this location. Even though there is a location quite near where I live, we make the trek to Paoli at least once a week-if not more- and have for the last year. It's our ""GO TO"" when salad is on the menu.

Even have a 'rewards card' and  consistently earn enough points to get free salads, cookies, etc. Awesome, really.

So what you should take away from this so far is --- BIG FAN.

Okay. Now for the bucket of cold, ice water and a trip to harsh reality.

A week ago, a friend and I went to the Paoli location. The lot was empty so we sorta high-fived at our luck. This place can get crowded especially during lunch hour. We entered, stopped for a minute at the beverage case to pick up some NakedJuice then proceeded to the order area. 
La dee dah ~ Dah de laaaaaaa. Hellooooo? Anyone here?  Crickets(my way of saying we were met with silence)
Ooooookay. Let's try again only much louder. HELLOOOO? HELLOOO? ANYONE HERE? More crickets.

By this point, four or five minutes has passed since we entered. The door opens and another customer comes in and gets in line behind us. My friend looks at me and says - ""This is weirding me out. WTF?""  I agree. It seemed more than odd that there were NO workers hovering, answering, making noise in the back. Nothing. 

The customer who walked in mutters...""Hope we don't end up on the news - think something bad happened back there?"" Seriously, holy crap. Sounds funny to say something like that but let's face it. We live in a crazy world where you almost HAVE to consider something bad was going on when we were WAY past five minutes and not a single employee appeared or made a noise.

Luckily, someone eventually MAGICALLY appeared. The person behind us mutters - ""Jeez. Probably out back smoking and now gonna make salads. Sweet.""

It pretty much went downhill from there. The salads (we ate in) were 'meh"" and we had to change tables because there were several stink bugs clearly evident INSIDE the windows where we first sat. That's when we started noticing how dirty the floors were. 

My friend ( who is by NO means a complainer) went to the ladies restroom after we ate as I pulled the car up. When she came out, I knew she wasn't happy. She had a handful of wet papers towels which she used to wipe off the bottom of her shoes before she got in the car. ""That bathroom smelled like a truck stop. The pee smell was awful AND the floors were so sticky, I could hear my shoes. Ugh, gross.""

I know that all establishment have bad days but this went far and away beyond bad. 

Service - non existent. Salad - meh. Cleanliness - yeah, not so much. Bathroom - deal breaker.",2.6386666666666665,1.0,negative,15

Halfway across the continent in St. Louis Missouri only a few miles north of the Amhiezer Busch Brewery, one of the perks about living by Vegas was a luxury.

  As I have mentioned in numerous reviews, I greatly enjoy closing up the night with a bullet beer. If you are unfamiliar with a bullet beer, they are the 25 ounce can and 32 ounce bottle. It just relaxes me in the same way that watching TV, drinking hot cocoa, or whatever it is that relaxes other people.

  Where we stayed for seven nights in the 7th at Washington Street Embassy Suites next to America's Center there were no 7-Elevens or Walgreens that sells alcohol. The three options for beer were Schnuck's, Olive Market, and James Henry Pavillion. On account of the experience where customers harrased me for money in front of the useless cashier, I don't count Cupola, which by the way did not sell the bullet beer I like.

  James Henry Pavillion was the closest convenience and liquor store to the hotel. They were my beer hookup. I patronized this business two times. On each visit I'd buy a certain number of bullet cans that averaged out to one per night.

  I was impressed by their alcohol selection. By the way they also sell food that includes Boar's Head. At any rate, I was further impressed by the fact that the only true liquor and convenience store in downtown St. Louis sold the beer at competitive prices. For crying out loud, the bullet beer here is less expensive than a Walmart Supercenter. This is the first time that I ever saw a 32 ounce can of Miller Lite. For $2.06 after taxes it was a steel. Drinking it was an even greater steel.

  If you are like me, and appreciate ending the night with a 32 ounce cold one and your downtown hotel room has a refrigerator, I suggest walking (speedwalking at night) to James Henry Provisions and stocking up on the 32 ounce cold ones. The hard to find product that I brought here greatly added to my quality of night in St. Louis.",2.38375,3.38,neutral,16

I booked with this venue in the beginning of my engagement after meeting with Pat. He spent the entire meeting discussing all the lovely renovations that would be done prior to our wedding taking place.  Pat said that the renovations would be done over the summer (well before my wedding would take place in June the following year).  A few months later (after little communication from my initial meeting with Pat) we had our food tasting.  The food tasting was an absolute disaster. From the food being disgusting and bland and tasting like high school cafeteria food, to receiving a $60 check afterwards because our mothers came.  We were completely livid.  But the icing on the cake was the zero renovations that still hadn't been done, months after we paid the deposit. The very next day I left Pat a voicemail and sent him an email.  I'm a paralegal, so I'm extremely thorough and attentive to detail.  I emailed Pat all of my correspondences with Melissa showing that she never stated that I couldn't bring our 2 freaking parents and asked for the full refund.  I also mentioned the renovations that he promised that clearly weren't ever done.  Pat became a completely different person.  He said the food tasting was only for the bride and groom.  I explained that it was never stated in any paperwork that it was complimentary for just the two of us.  Our mothers paid for the wedding, and I don't eat meat so I would like more than one person's review of this food.  I also asked how can you charge for additional food, when you still presented us with one plate for everyone to share.  He said it's their policy and no refund would be issued.  Then I asked about the renovations and why the venue looked exactly the same.  First, he acted as if he never made any promises about renovations, then after I kept asking several questions, he back tracked and said that it's hard to get the licenses for renovations in the county.  So basically, no renovations would be done prior to my wedding.  At this point I was absolutely livid.  First if you are going to nickel and dime me now for freaking $60 then this is going to be a long process.  Second, I would have never ever booked with that venue based on how it looked.  Everything in the ballroom looked outdated, the carpet was dingy and old, and the venue as a whole looked old, and I literally had stopped looking at venues based off the lies Pat had told us. So, I told Pat that I was unhappy and would rather book somewhere else and that I wanted my deposit back.  Initially, he said no.  Then when I threatened legal action, he gave us our deposit back immediately.
THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS DONT BOOK WITH PAXON HOLLOW. From Pat being a con artist, to Melissa they are just horrible and honestly seem as if they don't fully comprehend customer service.  Two weeks after firing Paxon Hollow, I booked with Regal Ballroom and we just got married on June 10th.  They were literally the polar opposite of Paxon Hollow. Netty, and Chris were so amazing and attentive. The food at the food tasting was amazing, we were allowed to bring our moms, the entire venue was brand new and by the wedding day they had even made some tweaks to the bridal suite, we were able to keep the same date as before, had a million times better customer service, and paid a lot less then Paxon Hollow.  

P.S. See Dan's May 2017 review on wedding wire where he also outlines the poor customer service, the horrible food, and the ""renovations"" that Pat is promising to everyone",2.391428571428571,1.0,negative,14

   ---   ---   ---

Full disclosure: I've never been a huge fan of Kahwa. I tend to prefer just about any other coffee shop, but my wife and I were walking through the mall and she pointed this shop out as we walked by. She mentioned that her friend was totally head over heels in love with the cold brew from Kahwa. Meanwhile, I still couldn't get over the fact that Kahwa was taking up a storefront that would normally belong to some kind of clothing shop. It was nowhere near the food court - I really can't recall seeing such a random location for something in a mall before. But my wife's friend's endorsement had me curious enough to give it a shot.

The guy behind the counter asked if I wanted him to leave room for cream/sugar and while I initially said no, I ended up saying that he could sprinkle a couple drops of hazlenut in there. This was one of the better decisions I've made in a while. This was an absolutely delicious beverage and the caffeine had me feeling like I was on quite the high afterward.

So, despite some previous underwhelming experiences, I have to give props to Kahwa for providing us an alternative to Starbucks at International Mall!",3.736923076923077,3.7199999999999998,neutral,13

There's a couple Lattes I'd suggest including:

1.) Aloha (Macadamia/Coconut) -  I wanted it so badly, but it's a summer item (seasonal).

2.) Salted Caramel is so good - the sweetness & saltiness is a highlight of this drink.

This was one of the many yucky-no-no's that I encountered in Tucson. ""Oh, how cute!"" I thought to myself. ""I'm SUCH a fan of local pizza places! & look, they have flavored crusts, doesn't that sound interesting? Let's give 'em a try!""

Can you spot the mistakes?

Well, first off, it turns out Howie's was only a ""local pizza place"" in the fact that their building was in our town. They're a chain, & they have locations in at least ten states. I didn't know this, I had never heard of them until their ad ended up in my mailbox. Maybe I should've Googled them first, but I didn't think about it. I wanted pizza, & I was lured in by their ""flavored crusts."" They looked good in the pictures, I swear!

Speaking of the flavored crusts, we got our pizza with half butter, half garlic herb. Maybe we should have tried something that could have potentially had a stronger flavor? The butter tasted like flavorless pizza crust. The garlic herb fared slightly better, at least I could see the herbs... oh yes! There's that faint trickle of garlic flavor. Oh, no wait, it's gone now.

Beyond the crust, the pizza was pretty average, bordering on disappointing. It was kinda bland & felt like the type of pizza that would be served in bulk, perhaps in a cafeteria or sitting under a heat lamp for a few hours in a lunch buffet somewhere.

We also ordered some ""Howie Bread."" I think ""Howie"" must mean ""rock hard & devoid of any interesting flavor"" because that's what our bread was. Maybe it was sitting out for a while, maybe it was overcooked, who knows. I don't think I want to know.

We placed our order online. We got a phone call about twenty minutes after placing the order, because apparently their website SUCKS & sent them multiple copies of our order (while on our end, telling us our order had not been sent, & to try again or call them to place it). They called to let us know, & to make sure we didn't really want three identical pizzas/orders of bread. That was nice of them. Of course, something else had to go wrong, right? Well, Mr. Delivery Guy did sort of get lost on the way to our apartment. We got our food about an hour after they called us. :( But for what it's worth, as far as service went, the person on the phone & the delivery guy were both friendly. It's just the wait time, the online ordering system, & the food that sucked.

So yeah. One star because it was pretty bad overall.
One additional star because they were nice, & somehow, it still doesn't feel like the worst pizza I've ever had. Also, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt on their other ""flavored crusts"" & hoping I just tried them on a really, really *deep breath* REALLY bad night.

It's truly upsetting she had to deal with this after she just had a long day and just wanted some comfort food. Below is what happened to her:


I have been a regular patron at this restaurant for years. However, today I was appalled by the way I was treated at this location by Inbran. I placed my order, pulled up to the window, Inbran read back to me my order, and I explained it was incorrect. I proceeded to repeat what my order was, including 3 apple pies. She said, ""We don't have any apple pies."" I informed her that the person who took my order, confirmed they were available. As she yells at me, ""We don't have any and we are about to close"" (half an hour before close time), another employee began to place the apple pies in the bag. She then proceeded to rudely ask, ""Well, are you going to pay or not?"" Taken aback by the consistent animosity, I simply told her she could've just acknowledged making a mistake and I was unsure as to why she was being hostile. Then, she slammed the window in my face. 

I would think, especially during these times that businesses and people are struggling to pay bills and make ends meet (due to COVID-19), you would want to maintain customers and repeat business. However, Inbran is pushing customers away. I asked another employee for her name and was advised that this has been an on going issue with this same person that is supposedly training to be a manager, which prompted me to write a review. She very clearly doesn't have the capacity to de-escalate situations, lead by example, or at the very least..provide good customer service.",2.4193333333333333,1.0,negative,15

It. was. awful! It doesn't hold a feathered and beaked candle to the Chick Fil A Spicy Chicken Sandwich. Chick Fil A's vastly superior version actually has the spices and flavoring seared into the breast and the hotness is perfectly matched with the Pepper Jack Cheese and the mayonnaise cools it off. 

Unlike the disgusting sandwich I couldn't even finish choking down from Popeyes, the Chick Fil A sandwich isn't overly thick or ridiculously breaded. It just didn't taste good. The breast was too thick, the sauce didn't improve the sandwich, and there was no cheese.

It also just looks sloppy and messy and didn't taste any better than it looked. Chick Fil A's sandwich actually looks deliciously tasty, there isn't meat hanging out all over the bun, it's compact and appealing and inviting.

This is the crappiest chicken sandwich I have ever eaten at a fast food chain. Chick Fil A's is the gold standard and Wendys' Spicy Chicken Sandwich is much better. I would have been better off ordering McDonald's Spicy McNuggets which is considerably better than this overhyped tripe.

This Dunkin' Donuts is in route to my job and I remember the days when it use to be my favorite stop before walking through the glass doors at my office.  I recall holding that warm brown cup of caramel latte thinking to myself ""Today is going to be a Good Day!"" My only complaint was that this location was always crowded, but its congestion made sense considering its location; therefore no need complaining about the inevitable. Because this location is small, customers were packed in making ordering a little confusing as you never knew who was next in line, but we were all pleasant, including the staff, and as adults we figured it out! Oh...the good ole days! Fast Forward!

Not sure WHAT happened, but the old staff is gone and a new herd of gum popping baristas have taken over. The first time I visited this location under its new staff, initially I was digging the new vibe, Montell Jordan's ""This is how we do it"" was blasting from the speakers, but then I noticed how much longer the wait was, how unprofessional the staff were, AND THEN I reached the counter to place my order only to be told that the latte machine was down! How is this possible, a latte machine is down in a coffee shop? What's next, no donuts? I was pissed AND late to work! I mean they could have saved me a fifteen minute and put a ""The Latte Machine is Down"" sign up, or something! Press Fast Forward again!

This morning, I decided to give his location a second chance. This time, there was no long line, I am assuming that all of the old customers found another Dunkin Donuts to go to, but again, the latte machine was down!!!!!! Rewind... the manager asked a cashier if the latte machine was still down, 

(Still down?? How long can a coffee shop function without a latte machine? Talk about profit loss...anyhoo...)

she looked at him and said ""it's right behind you, why don't you turn around and see if it's down for yourself."" My mouth flew open! You can only imagine the look of shock on my face...oh my at the insubordination...off with her head! It's safe to say that I will not be visiting this location again.

Previously known as City Grocer before Schnucks Culinaria moved in up the street, City Gourmet has gotten rid of the specialty and overpriced groceries and now concentrates on making yummy, filling meals.

Ultimately, I go to City Gourmet for three things:

* veggie burrito
* or veggie stir-fry
* followed by a Mom's Originals chocolate-caramel-covered pretzel.

The burritos are absolutely delicious! There are suggestions on the board, but they're stuffed with pretty much whatever you want. I always get the Alcupulco burrito (Did I spell that correctly? Probably not. Oh well, too lazy to look it up this morning.). The quantity of each ingredient is just right. There's never, say, too much salsa or too little cheese. The City gourmet folks know how to make a good burrito.

I usually get a burrito, so I've only had the veggie stir-fry once. It was  excellent. You go to the little stir-fry ingredients shelves and plop whatever you want into a provided bowl -- rice, peppers, those weird tiny ears of corn, etc. Hand it to the guy (probably the same guy who makes your burrito), who fries it all up and serves you hot goodness. 

There's one particular burrito/stir-fry guy there who is absolutely awesome. I keep meaning to get his name. He's super-friendly, young, and makes damn tasty food (he's also pretty cute, ladies). Moreover, he's helpful! He'll suggest trying different burrito sauces with different vegetables, or adding more of a certain topping for a different taste. One time, I didn't put a ton into my stir-fry bowl -- I wasn't feeling that great but still needed to eat, so I only wanted mostly rice with a few peppers and hardly any sauce. This guy didn't know my tummy was weird, so he was adamant that I put more veggies into my bowl so I could get my money's worth. He was trying to GIVE ME MORE FOOD! Love!

At the checkout counter, City Gourmet carries individually wrapped Mom's Originals pretzels in both dark and milk chocolate. You have to read my Mom's review to get the full scoop on this item, but I love-love-love that I can pick one up as my after-dinner treat.

The general ambiance of City Gourmet is quite pleasant. I love a mix of store plus coffeeshop plus eatery. There are tables where you can consume your vittles while reading various publications, and there's wifi if you need to do work. Personally, I just like sitting near the window and watching life happen as I eat. There's seating upstairs, too.

The only  thing that's a little confusing is that there are two food-making stations -- one for wraps/salads (which I haven't had yet) and one for burritos/stir-fry. The wrap counter is the first one you see, and it's the one with the cash register. Naturally, this is the one you'd gravitate toward. However, if you want a burrito and the only worker available is behind the wrap counter, you can get a little confused about what's going on. Is the burrito counter closed? Is the unseen burrito worker taking a break? Why is there no cash register there? Etc. After you see everything in action once, it becomes obvious that if you stand at the burrito counter, the wrap guy will make his way over there. You just feel dumb when you don't know what's going on.

City Gourmet also carries deli items, sweets, soft drinks, beer and a very few grocery items. I don't deal with any of these, so I can't comment.

Two more incentive to go: They have a frequent buyer's card where if you buy a certain number of entrees (I think 12?), you'll get one free. Also, City Gourmet is close to the 8th and Pine Metrolink station, which makes it easy to stop by for dinner after work or for office workers to grab a quick lunch.

- Free parking for customers. Sure, sometimes the lot is full, but it's an extra bonus if there's a spot available.
- Build-your-own stir-fry bar. You pick the ingredients, put it in a bowl, pick your protein and sauce and they whip it up for you. Just like the chain, Stir Crazy, only it's not a chain.
- Baked goods the size of your head for $2 or less! I picked up a sampler box of cupcakes (giant!) and brownies the other night and it cost less than $10! And all of us who sampled them agreed that they were delicious.
- A majority of the products they carry are either organic or locally made. Hells yes!

It seems I have found the *perfect* store to totally cure my grocery/supermarket phobia and it's a 3-hour drive from where I live. What am I supposed to do? Relive the moment!  Write a review! 

City Gourmet is as close to a NYC Korean market as you can get, but it's even better. Why? It is shockingly affordable. As in, you can actually do the bulk of your grocery shopping here, especially if you like the specialty stuff like I do, and it won't set you back as though you might as well have eaten out. This is an appreciated contrast to most gourmet markets I've been known to blow a paycheck in.

What's more, they have made to order sandwiches, salads and stir fry stations that remind me of those days when I was happy to have left lunch at home, no matter how hard I was attempting to save money. Nothing like a made to order fresh lunch!

I had one of the stir fry dishes.  You pick out the vegetables, protein and starch (this is just *made* for picky people like me who shudder when there are onions, carrots or bell pepper in my stir fry!) In other cities, I have rejoiced when this option was available and gladly paid the 10 dollars it cost so that I could get exactly what I wanted (broccoli, snow peas, white mushrooms, bamboo shoots, sprouts, hot chilis and tofu). At City Gourmet, this feast is about 3 dollars cheaper than I am used to paying.

Moving on to the baked goods area (really, I shouldn't), I marveled over the size of the cupcakes (carrot and red velvet among others). And then I saw the price. Less than 2 dollars--WHAT? I also saw very tempting cookies and slices of cake, as well as one of my favorite things in the world: pretzel bread. Sadly on this day I was being good and trying to stick to just vegetables.  

They have a good selection of soft drinks, juices and my favorite Stevia sodas in the beverage area, along with a variety of vitamin and plain waters. Many organic choices.

I didn't look at every area, but what I saw was artfully arranged and of course I dig the fact that they have some good wines available, too.

So on a Friday afternoon when my co-workers were being bums about lunch, I made the trek over by myself to check it out.

But before reviewing my lunch experience, I have to reiterate that this place kicked major ass for the Yelp event.  Everyone was so nice and they had a nice upstairs space for the event.  Staff members even came out and served various different varieties of stir fry.

Speaking of which, when I returned for lunch I went straight for the stir fry.  If there's one thing I hate, it's awkwardly trying to figure out the proper protocol when trying something new.  I have had stir fry before, but this setup was a bit unusual.  To save readers of this review potential hassle and awkwardness let me explain it to you how this works:

1) Walk over to the burrito/stir fry bar.  Grab a bowl from the bottom shelf and fill it up with as many vegetables as you can fit.

2) To the left of that will be a notepad and pencil for you to fill out with your choice of meat, starch, and sauce.

3) Turn it in and wait.  You can get it to go or to eat there.

My stir fry was very tasty, but I am not a huge vegetable person.  Instead of being like half vegetables and half meat/rice (the real tasty stuff) I would've preferred like 25% vegetables and 75% tasty stuff.  But I was still pleased.  The price was right ($7 bucks and some change) and it was done quickly enough that I had plenty of time to walk back to the office and enjoy my lunch.  I will definitely come back to check out their burritos and sandwiches, both of which were raved about by a fellow customer while I was waiting for my stir fry.  They had some prepackaged Sushi that looked interesting too.

The grocery store portion of this store is excellent.  They seem to highlight more unique offerings, in what I assume is an attempt to compete with nearby Schnucks Culinaria.  But the beer selection - WOW!  I already feel like a kid in a candy store walking down any beer aisle in any grocery store.  But this place has an awesome selection of individual beer bottles, with the option to create your own six pack.  Hell yeah!  This isn't an original idea, but their selection is incredible.  

City Gourmet is a great downtown lunch choice, and great stop for some groceries too, especially if you love beer.  The employees are super nice and the store is very well organized, modern, and clean.  If I lived downtown, I would be here nearly everyday.  Mad props City Gourmet!",3.284705882352941,4.27,positive,17

The beautiful wife and I, in a breakfasty mood, headed down there this morning.  The fellow working the burrito bar seemed to be a bit overwhelmed (not your man Anna, don't worry!), but he managed to create a couple of gigantic breakfast burritos for us.

And they weren't just big -- there was quality to go along with quantity.  It's always terrifying to see a pot of scrambled eggs being scooped out -- how are these going to be?  Too dry?  Too wet?  Too fluffy?  Too flat? (is that the opposite of fluffy?)  Anyway, there was no reason to have any fears -- the eggs, along with the rest of the ingredients were flavorful and tasted fresh.

With one exception: the potatoes.  Now, I love having potatoes on my breakfast burritos, _but _ quartered new potatoes aren't the right way to go here.  At least cube them up!  But instead, there were these giant hunks of in the burrito, and they really had more of ""I should eat these with a steak, not at breakfast"" taste about them.

But that's just a minor issue -- next time, I'll simply avoid them (if they're prepared the same way of course).

One other issue was the guacamole -- we were there at 10:00 am and the guac was getting really brown.  Now, I know it's a pain in the ass to keep fresh and nice looking, but it looked really nasty.

All said, two burritos, an O.J. (just Minute Maid), and a Boylan root beer (that's the wife for you) came out to $10.11.  Not bad, not bad at all.",3.284705882352941,3.64,neutral,17

It's definitely a weird place, though.  You walk in and you have no idea where you order your food, pay, or even sit, really.  There's about three times as much space as is necessary for a joint like this.  And there are about a million different kinds of beer inexplicably lining the walls, but no plain old bottled water.

But beyond that, though, City Gourmet seems like a great place to stop for a reliable lunch if you're in the area.  I had their tuna salad sandwich, which featured a delicious avocado and pico de gallo spread.  The potato salad side fit right in, too.  (Wow, I really was on a mayonnaise kick, it seems.)

The menu, unfortunately, is a little pricey.  A sandwich, side, and Vitamin Water cost me just under $10.00.  I'd be more of a fan if it had ran me around $7.00; those few extra bucks can add up.

I guess they were one man short today, as the same guy was hurrying back and forth between the sandwich station and the cash register.  If I was on a 30-minute, I would not have been all that happy.

Fortunately, though, the comfortable and convenient upstairs seating made City Gourmet a fine place to relax, eat, and people watch.  I'll be back, if I find myself in that area!",3.284705882352941,2.14,neutral,17

Ah, the good old days, when I could pop in for snacks and drinks before headed to Forest Park. When I would stop by for lunch daily and spend way too much on their amazing salad bar and decadent desserts.

I was surprised--and worried--when I heard that City Gourmet would repurpose itself with the arrival of Culinaria. Would they make it? 

Turns out, yes, yes they can.
While I mourn that salad bar, I do love the stir-fry, burrito, and sandwich bars that replaced it. The seating is still available upstairs, the beer and beverages didn't leave, and the desserts, thank goodness, went nowhere. Neither did the staff--they're still as friendly as ever.

They have a few freshly baked and wrapped desserts that will definitely put a smile on your face. Maybe not as good on the wasteline, but they sure are tasty! (Take the 4""x4"" gooey butter bars, for example...)

I would recommend putting City Gourmet on your list of places to get lunch during the week.

Entered on a whim, my wife and I discovered Globe Drug after doing some business at the U.S. Post Office.  I had seen it once or twice and had little desire to check it out.  I don't know why, but that side of Broadway always keeps me looking over my shoulder.  The vagrants seem to gravitate to the area.

My wife insisted that we go inside, and I'm glad that she did.  This place has a boatload of crap!  If you're looking for odd finds or just want to take a walk down Memory Lane, Globe Drug is a good place to do these things.  I found a box of 1991 Fleer Baseball Cards unopened!  Why?  I have no idea.  Needless to say, I bought a couple of packs.

They have weird discounts on random items.  We found an Abita summer beer for $3.98, normally $7.99 at the corner store.  Chocolate cream filled Twinkees?  They've got them for $1.49!  They must get overstock from other places at a fraction of the cost.  There's a whole section of day old Hostess snacks for ridiculously cheap!

Globe Drug is not the place to do your grocery shopping.  However, their prices are pretty much on par with Vincent's or even Schnucks, but finding something specific could be difficult.  The soul purpose to me is finding those bizarre odds and ends that I can't find anywhere else.",3.8888235294117646,3.95,neutral,17

You  an always find some seasonal items, greeting cards, wine, cooking products, and chocolate. The one thing that few people know is that Globe makes their own Chocolate downstairs in this location, its very good and a very reasonable price. Some of the chocolate they offer is turtles, chocolate covered nuts, heavenly hash, and a wide variety of other chocolates, the best part is that if you are planning on cooking with chocolate you can but a large block for much less than you could at Wal-Mart, and its much better.

Otherwise, it's a giant jumble of fun -- everything from deeply discounted holiday candy (on time for every major holiday), homemade chocolates and locally-roasted coffee (they do this onsite) to cleaning staples.  I don't buy PineSol or toilet bowl cleaner anywhere else, because you can't beat Globe's prices and you can toss as many impulse buys in your cart as you want, and STILL get away for less money than you would have at any other store.

I finish my errands, get home and unwrap my sandwich. I'm immediately disappointed. The turkey was the fresh roasted kind and I was looking forward to deli style.

The presentation of the sandwich was on point! They rolled everything together so it all stayed in place. The bread was soft and flaky. I really couldn't ask for a better sandwich. My GF is the pickiest eater I know and she finished her entire sandwich.

The food, drinks, decor, are all good - high quality Asian food that's fast. Right in-between fast-food and dine-in. Price was falls right in between too.

The thing that stands out most with this particular Pei Wei is it's size. It's most similar to the one in Green Hills, perhaps smaller, while the one in Brentwood is larger. The size has it's pros and cons: Our food came to us almost immediately, and because we were there in the evening, we didn't have to deal with a lunch rush, so finding a table wasn't hard at all. Of course, this just makes me wonder how bad the lunch rush would be.

It's proximity to Whole Foods, and everything else that's growing around McEwen and Mallory is a big plus. I think that area is going to be one of the nicest spots in Cool Springs - if you don't mind the traffic that will come with it.",1.4306666666666668,3.15,neutral,15

After about 3 minutes, I asked the one dining room server if he could please buss a table for us. After about two more minutes of waiting (as he scurried to get orders to tables), I walked to the counter, grabbed the towel and bussed the table myself so we could sit. 

My Pei Wei Spicy chicken salad was ok. The chicken was cooked perfectly (the only reason I gave 2 stars) but the salad was over dressed. I ate the chicken but only a little bit of the actual salad.

2. Decor was surprising, not fast food joint: Velvet elvis on the wall, as well as movie posters from cult classics ranging from easy rider, pulp fiction, to Anchorman. Funny. 
3. Menu consisted of chicken fingers only. 3 or 4 finger meals or a handful on a bun. Sides were fries and/or slaw. Only one sauce choice unless you count ketchup.

5. Staff was really, really nice. No attitude which is so common in fast food joints. The cashier spied my military ID and gave me a discount without me asking or anything.

In fact, I was at LSU when the very first Raising Cane's was open (now I'm dating myself).

I remember the first store like it was yesterday.  A tiny little joint with booths, exposed walls, and down the hill right off the LSU campus near Chimes.  There was a tiny drive through that would get packed late at night when everyone needed their fix.  Back then there were no options, just a 5 piece box, no one wanted slaw so we always ordered extra toast and extra cane sauce.  It was a college hangout and now I'm pleasantly surprised to have it everywhere!  I have spent the rest of my life trying to recreate that cane sauce to no avail.  Now I LOVE the cane sauce, texas toast, crinkly fries, and the chicken fingers are good too (hehe...).

The kids that work here are always friendly and polite.  She apologized that it would take 8 minutes since I was the first customer.  No biggie, the sauce alone is worth my wait!

They're exactly the same as I remember them. What always stood out to me was the freshness of their donuts. They are very light and airy. They'd definitely beat any grocery store donut. The maple is very sweet. I don't understand how anything as sweet as their maple could taste like anything except pure sugar, but it does have good taste. I particularly enjoyed their chocolate buttermilk donut. It's a lot more dense than a normal donut, but had a very crispy outside that wasn't oily. Overall, the texture was excellent.

Prices range from 60 cents and go up, depending on the fanciness of your donut. They have some other pastries as well. A mixed dozen is significantly cheaper. 

It's your typical donut shop, so don't expect anything special in terms of service, but the person at the counter greeted me and was friendly. They have soda, coffee, juice, milk, etc.

I ordered the much-vaunted Cowgirl Tri-Tip Panini (Creekstone Farms Tri Tip, Caramelized Onions, Thyme, Goat Cheese, Dijon, Goat Cheese Spread, Sourdough), and was NOT disappointed.  The goat cheese spread combined with dijon really compliments the other ingredients, and the tri-tip was done to perfection.  Some grilled or roast beef sandwiches require that you really work to chew through the meat (a sign of improperly or hastily cooked meat), but these thin-sliced layers of tri-tip were like buttah.  MMMMMMMMMM!  

My order was served to me 5-10 minutes after I ordered (not exactly sure on the time, but I know I was surprised it appeared so quickly), and the bread was not soggy even though it had to sit in a container while I drove back to my office.  Tasty, crispy, perfect.  The small mixed green salad with homemade balsamic vinaigrette was a perfect compliment.

The price was on par with similar fare in Reno ($9); the same they charge for this sandwich at Dish Cafe.  $12 for lunch is not something I can afford to do often (tax + tip), but this was a REALLY good sandwich.  I'll definitely be visiting the truck again the next time it's in my neighborhood.  Now if they'd just post a month's advance calendar and put out a Twitter feed, they'll be set.

I know this sounds like pure hyperbole, but this was by far the best Reuben I've had served to me at a restaurant in the West.  Purists will note the substitution of pastrami for corned beef, and the schmear is considerably different than the usual fare, but that's exactly WHY this is the best Reuben I've had in recent memory.

Staff was very kind, courteous and helpful in their suggestions.

Order time to delivery was 10 or so minutes. My wife and I ordered the Dish Torta (carnitas) and Turkey Pesto Panini. I had the Torta and got the chipotle sauce on the side (i'm a wimp). The carnitas was cooked perfectly - moist, flavorful. Mmm. The Chipotle sauce was a nice touch. It was extremely flavorful but not too spicy. It was nice and thick too so it stuck to the sandwich and didn't slide / drip off. I slathered it on top of my carnitas and polished off the last half of the sandwich with it covered in sauce. The salad on the side was nice. Small amount but the perfect accompaniment to the sandwich. Delicious.

My wife had the Turkey Pesto Panini. Crunchy and not soggy. Pesto was delicious but a very heavy spread. The dijon was nice and not too overpowering. Salad on the side, again, a nice touch.

We grabbed a White Wine Cupcake to go and snacked on it later at home. Cupcake was dry (perhaps because we ate it an hour or so after ordering it) and had a cream cheese frosting. I hate cream cheese frosting so I only took one bite. Wifey said she would have eaten more (she enjoys cream cheese frosting) but the cake was too dry.

I didn't get a $2.75 cupcake, but I wish they said what flavors they had.

I'll try them again when I can afford it.

Update: The owners contacted me and promptly addressed my price issue, saying that the meat is humanely raised and thus $$ reflects that. That being said, they did say they might get bigger pitas and give out more balls.

Atmosphere - 4 stars
Food - 5 stars
Service - 5 stars

Background - Love their restaurant and this makes it easier to get their food, just not the same vibe though.  I knew the truck was going to be at the Spark's Farmers Market so that was a bonus since we were going.

Atmosphere - I stick with comments about the truck.  I love that they have TV/Monitor for the menu board, very modern.  Here is the real problem with it, the font is too small and the black with white back ground makes it very difficult to read from a distances. These things are easy to fix.  You could get really fancy with this and have pictures with a description of the items, and scroll from one screen to the next.  Maybe start off simply with the DISH Truck logo in the background to give it some color.

Food
  Appetizer - Straight to the sandwich, none needed today. 

  Main Course - I have been craving the cowgirl, and I got her tonight.  Boy did that sound wrong. lol.  I love tri tip.  I wish the meat was doubled on it, but the price would probably be too.  It is easily one of my favorite sandwiches in town. 

  Dessert - no time with all the fresh fruit at the market, gotta go get some of it.

This place has a lot of potential but unfortunately it was a complete let down.

I also had a apple martini that was really strong. They did not offer a range of wines but only moscato. 

It was Valentine's Day and just myself and girlfriend were the only customers in the restaurant. The server was nice. The music was loud (went from playing a 90s slow jam song to next playing Meek Mill 2018) and a lot of flashing and moving lights.

Penny's is a simple pizza shop with a few items on the menu.  Pizza, Stromboli, Calzone, Lasagna, and Tomato Pie.  They also have some sides like Mozzarella sticks, fries, chicken fingers, garlic sticks....And if you want to eat it later you can do ""take and bake"" and heat it up at home...Beverages are all bottled in the cooler and they have hot slices ready to go.

Service is great and very friendly, almost everyone working there smiled or said hi.  They are still new in town and working hard to impress folks, good work at the front counter!

The pizzas looked good sitting in their little heated cabinet on the counter(these pies are for slices), but I was curious about the stromboli and gave it a shot.  Got the Ham and Cheese and was utterly unimpressed.  If I had to guess(which I do because I didn't ask) I would say it was filled with american cheese rather than the mozzarella mix that I'm used to.  It also didn't have any sauce in it, which I'm used to getting in my stromboli.  The crust was very crisp, which actually made it hard to eat with a knife and fork as the melted cheese and ham just kept falling out of the crust I cut off before I could get it off the plate and into my mouth.  It wasn't exactly what I was expecting so was a bit let down, but your mileage may vary.

Note:  they use Cornmeal in their dough, and it's quite prominent given their website name: http://www.gotcornmeal.com. I'm not familiar with this, but from a little reading see it really crisps the crust.  Some feel negatively about it on their pizza, others rave about it.  Check it out and see what you think.

Even though it was busy all the time they still made it just the way I liked it. The new location in Oaks, not so much.... The calzones were a joke, the cheese wasn't even melted (had about 5 lbs. of it in there) and there was very little meat in it. When I called to let them know about my dissatisfaction, the cook stated "" well, you're not getting your money back!"" even though I never intended to ask for a refund. All I wanted was to let them know it was very poorly made and if they kept making it this way they would loose a lot of business. He handled it in a very unprofessional manner. I asked to speak to a manager since he was not taking my words to heart and he stated that he was the manager and sarcastically told me to have a nice night before he hung up on me.

It's an acquired taste with the cornmeal crunch and the sweet sauce on top.  It was a long drive so we usually only get it about every 2 months.  We were thrilled with the closer location and tried it tonight.  We got our usual large with half pepperoni.  The crust was a little thicker than usual, seemed to need a little more time in a hotter oven and lacked the classic cornmeal crunch.  Service was polite, but seemed inexperienced and disorganized.  Hopefully with time they will improve.  The dining room is bland and uninviting.  The pizza for slices under the heat lamp looked pretty gross.  There are thousands of people that grew up with this pizza and crave it.  If they can make it the right way consistently, they will be sitting on a gold mine.

We were blown away but the service and food for a new restaurant opening on the heels of a pandemic.

We always give a little grace to new restaurants, and restaurants in general right now when everyone is short staffed. However, had we not known that they just opened a few weeks ago - we would have had no idea. The evening ran smoothly and we were so pleased with our experience.

For drinks we tried cocktails, but they also had sangria pitchers, mocktails, and offer a great happy hour 4-6 on Wednesdays and Thursday's. We'll definitely be back for that as drinks are half off.

The food is Mediterranean influence. Tons of great appetizers like the whipped feta. For dinner there are kebabs as well as large plates, but I think you could opt to just share a number of apps and be satisfied as well. We got the slow roasted lamb and prawn kebabs - the lamb was unbelievable, fall off the bone tender.

We visited shortly after opening so we'll give a pass on the slow service. The kitchen just took a long time to bring our food. Not the waiter's fault. 

The ambiance was spectacular. Seating at either the bar or tables offers a cozy experience. The menu is small but has authentic Middle eastern vibes with chicken/meat kebabs as the main entrees. The meat was very soft and cooked perfectly but didn't have that coal-fire flavor that we prefer. This isn't necessarily a bad thing depending on personal preference. The only reason for a 4 rather than 5 star review is the prices. $20+ is way too much for one skewer.

Even more so, the hostess wasn't aware of this until a manager came & told her 'bar only' 30seconds after I walked in and abruptly walked away for the inexperienced hostess to figure out what'e next. 

I was very disappointed in the lack of communication or even customer service from the Manager. I understand it's a new restaurant and they are still working through nuisances but good communication & kindness goes a long way. Unfortunately, we didn't want to wait the 45mins in the empty restaurant!

Small plates are my absolute favorite way to dine, and sadies has a great selection of Mediterranean dishes to share with friends and family. The restaurant itself has one of the BEST patio layouts in Nashville, and the interior is warm and inviting. I like to call it ""grandma chic,"" but to most, it's probably vintage bohemian. The chandeliers in the center ads a lively ambiance, and there are thoughtful touches throughout. Love the unique glassware and attention to details like pillows on benches. As for the food, chef Margaret LaVetty has the gift of creating food that brings you comfort. I'm talking the type of food you'd share with loved ones sipping wine or digging in with girlfriends you haven't seen in years. The food just feels like a big hug. We ordered quite literally the entire menu, and were blown away with the plating alone. Wow! The details really matter here, and thats admirable. The mezze plate is a great sampler of ""things done right,"" like hummus, perfect olives omg, and probably the best babaganoush I've ever had. The pita was crispy and delish, and I'm a sucker for tri colored carrots. Next, we ordered falafel, which if you're reading this Chef, that was the best falafel I've had. I've eaten those little fried balls all over Europe and America, and I'm telling you, you've ruined me. I will be coming back for your falafel more than I should!!! My partner had the lamb meatballs and was blown away by the depth of flavor and from what I smelled, they were perfect. We ordered the sumac squash, lemon potatoes, and we picked carrots too. All of the sides were so yummy and I enjoyed having bites from all of them. Our server Kylee, who was lovely, sent us the crispy artichokes to try as well (thank you so much!) and they were amazing! Tender but crisp, and the dill aioli was creamy and tart! We will definitely be coming back for some large plates, and enjoyed seeing them come out of the kitchen. Next time we are also bringing a group so we can get more food haha! Lastly, the wine list is spectacular. I work at a wine bar, so I had high hopes. Sadies did not disappoint. You don't see a lot of wines of the Middle East on menus, so having those options for Nashvillians to experience, is really special. Thank you to the manager Patrick, our wonderful server Kylee, the friendly hosts and staff, and to chef Margaret for creating such a wonderful date night for us.

I stopped by with a friend to see if it's just about the same as the other location. Food, yes, customer service, no. 
Staff was very discourteous towards customers, and from first hand experience. 
Portions: very little meat, since ordering the asada for the price of $8 is not worth a small scoop of tiny cut meat. 
Since the side where the vegetables were hidden, I was unable to see how much was added onto the bowl, another, very small amount of lettuce to accommodate. 
If $8 bowl of asada, beans, lettuce, rice of a portion enough for a child, then it's just overpriced.

I wish partial star awards were available  This place would be awarded a half a star based solely upon the ""Oh hi!  You opened a restaurant!"" merit badge.  That's about all the credit this place deserves.

Unfortunately, Adobe Red's is yet another entry into the St. Louis tradition of producing slow-motion trainwrecks of mediocrity.  

Two of us eating, and we ordered the tamales ($8.99) and the stacked enchilada ""Christmas style"" ($9.99).  

After placing our order, the server brought out a platter of Restaurant Depot's finest chips and salsa.  No flavor whatsoever, other than the fryer grease that the chips glanced at when they tried to reheat them in vain.  The salsa was gritty and had a pre-packaged flavor -- whether it was house-made or not, it sure didn't taste like it.  It didn't taste like much, actually.

The tamales were dry and crumbly with the unmistakable taste only an old tamal can have.  The pork inside was dry and lacked any flavor whatsoever.  The chile sauce on top was equally flavorless.

The stacked enchiladas are a southwestern tradition, and are actually really good if done right.  These are not done right.

Four tortillas on a plate, drenched in fryer grease, with the same above-mentioned dry pork sandwiched between.  This would be good if some more thought went into the preparation, but it was flavorless and required a lot of salt and hot sauce.

The red and green chile sauces on top of the stacked enchilada were absolutely flavorless.  No heat, no real flavor.  As someone who has a deep appreciation for true, authentic green and red chile sauces - this was a distinct disappointment.  

Sides served were beans and rice, of course.  However, these beans tasted like unseasoned chili beans straight from the can, requiring a lot of hot sauce and salt before giving up.  The rice tasted straight from the microwave and had that telltale plumpness and rubbery texture that you get with instant.  Again, no flavor.  I left my sides mostly untouched because the bland flavor wasn't worth the time.

I realize the aim here wasn't authentic Mexican -- it's southwestern style Mexican-influenced cuisine.  Unfortunately, it doesn't matter what style you attempt if you can't execute it well enough.  For this reason, Adobe Red's gets one star.",2.609375,1.0,negative,16

My husband and I agree that tt is absolutely spectacular!  Having spent over 5 years living in southern Arizona, we guarantee that it is true Southwestern cuisine.  Actually, it's better than many restaurants in the Southwest!

We started out with REAL Margaritas - 4 pure, simple fresh ingredients - tequila, triple sec, agave nectar and fresh lime juice.  BEST Margarita in St. Louis hands down!  

The salsa they serve has a mild sweetness (they roast their tomatoes and onions prior to making the salsa) that is balanced with just enough heat to keep your taste buds on notice.  The chips were just average which was surprising given the outstanding quality of everything else that we ate.

The pork tamale is tender and flavorful with a red sauce (called adobe sauce) that gives you enough heat to be interesting but not overpower the other flavors.  The chicken taco is the best taco I have ever eaten!   The chicken is moist and full of flavor, and the shredded cabbage gave it an wonderful taste and texture.  The touch of cilantro cream on top rounded out the perfect blend of flavors.

My husband had the stacked enchiladas (with egg!) and it is one of the most unique dishes we have ever devoured!  Visually striking, the taste lived up to it's looks!  And again, enough heat to let your mouth know you are eating Southwestern but not so much to drown the complexities of the other flavors in the dish.

We finished with the sopapillas which, to our great relief, ended our search for authentic sopapillas in St. Louis!! They are light and puffed up perfectly!   We're purists, so opted to only eat them only with honey and were rewarded with the most delightful ending to a meal that we've had in a long time!

Oh yes - on top of being uber-yummy, it is uber-reasonable providing incredible value for your $$!  All of the above, before tax, was less than $40 for both of us!

We are totally mystified by the handful of negative reviews, but clearly the reviewers have no clue as to what true Southwestern (NOT Mexican!) involves - a blend of sweet, spicy, heat, smokey flavors.

I came here expecting to grab a sandwich at ""The U,"" which evidently closed, and in it's place found a very appealing Mexican restaurant.

The house margarita as awful. I think whomever made the house mix put way too much sour mix in it because it tasted like high-concentrate sour mix. It was literally impossible to finish and tasted like I was sucking on a sour warhead candy. A house margarita is a staple and should set the tone for any Mexican restaurant.

The chorizo tacos were just okay. The meat was tasty, but way over-cooked and the lettuce mix definitely had a bagged appearance, where I expected a freshly cut mix. There was way too much lime in the sauce, so I began to think unpalatable doses of accent flavors were a running theme with Adobe Red's.

So, when I heard that New Mexican restaurant had opened in St. Louis I was ecstatic.  It is really a unique cuisine and I miss it.   (I love all different types of Mexican food - both authentic and the various adaptations in the US (Tex-Mex, etc.).  And St. Louis is a basically a barren wasteland for Mexican food on almost all fronts.)  So, Adobe Reds gets an extra star just for existing.  

It was a mixed experience, but overall positive.  I started with a margarita and was so happy.  It was very true to what a margarita should be and is if you are South of the border and not in a tourist trap.  Real limes were harmed in the making of this margarita - not the disgusting sweet nastiness that one most commonly finds.  The table next to us was freaked out that it was so sour, as was at least one reviewer here.  It is a matter of taste, but I will stand by it authenticity.  

The salsa had some a distinct Chipotle flavor to it that I wouldn't associate with NM.  That is more Tex-Mex.  (Which is a cited influence for the place.)   It was also a bit sweet, which was odd but not bad.  I appreciated the consistency.  This is what fresh tomatoes do if your not making sauce.  I hate when salsa resembles marinara.

The kitchen was nice enough to make straight up cheese enchiladas for me.  I love stacked enchiladas with fried eggs on top.  I dream of home because of them.  So, that is exactly what I ordered with green chile (that is how we spell it in NM).  It was a mixed experience.  The chile had a really nice flavor and some kick.  The consistency was a bit unusual for an enchilada sauce.  The egg was really nice also.  The tortillas in the enchilada were falling apart for some reason, which made it a bit mealy.  Also, the cheese could have been more melted.

My husband had the enchiladas with shredded beef.  He is always on the look out for Mexican food with shredded beef.  He also found aspects of the enchiladas off, but said the shredded beef was very, very good.

So, the beans were good.  But clearly something is wrong with the rice.  It is definitely hard.  This is not a regional quality.  They need to be revamped.

Finally, pull that salt shaker out - because almost everything needed more salt.  That's fine, you can always add salt - but you can't take it out if the kitchen over salts your food.

Firstly, the server gave us the main courses a minute after serving the appetizer flatbread (which we ordered way in advance). It's really a pet peeve of ours whenever we get served the main course even before we touch the appetizers!

Secondly, the main courses were very, very sub-par. My husband tolerated the chimichanga only because he slathered the salsa all over it. 

Unfortunately, not so lucky on my carne adovada, which is described as ""pecan smoked pork slow roasted and smothered with our red chile sauce.""

It was not slow roasted. It was hard like rubber. It didn't taste anything like pecan smoked. And that sauce? Flavorless. If you can imagine a cardboard-tasting sauce, that would be it. The rice and beans on the side were a bit hard and tasteless.

I'm very forgiving - normally I can tolerate sub-par food and finish my meal anyway. But I stopped eating right then and there. Two fistfuls worth of rubbery meat left uneaten.

But it surely wasn't for lack of trying!

I went with a buddy of mine to give this place a try and without even letting any food pass my lips I was greatly disappointed. 

I had to fight through the onslaught of guests lined up around the block to get into Pappy's before I could even get into Adobe Reds. I entered the building and waited a tick... looking for a sign from one of the servers (or an actual, factual sign). There was neither.

So I seated myself. I wasn't going to stand at the door like a cardboard cut out. I'd sit at a table like a human being while I waited for my friend. It took him about 5 minutes to meet me. Then we waited for either the waiter or waitress.

And waited. 

They buzzed by us several times, tending to a few other tables. The place wasn't packed, but they might have had two tables each. So I got up and retrieved a menu for my friend and I while we waited to be acknowledged. 

And waited. 

About 10 minutes later a gaggle of attractive, giggly teenage girls barged in the door and made a beeline for a table. With in seconds the male waiter practically jumped on them and demanded their order. 

Here's where I suspected something was wrong, but said nothing. My friend and I continued to inspect the remarkably short menu- and to muse over why they would call a deep fried burrito a 'chimichanga.' I'm not making that up... they explained it on the back... they just said 'to hell with it' and decided to make chimichangas out of deep fried burritos. They didn't SERVE burritos... just their version of the chimichanga. Definitely a creative interpretation of 'authentic'.

At about 15 minutes later, a group of portly, older men walked through door, seated themselves and were immediately attended by the female waitress. Now it was my turn to say 'to hell with it.' My friend and I proceeded to leave without another word.

I got the stacked enchilada w/ chicken and my husband got the chicken soft tacos.  I could not even eat 1/4 of the chicken enchiladas and I was super hungry and they were covered in cheese (usually means I will eat anything...).  There was something off about the food.  It had a strange skunky taste.  The chicken did not taste like real chicken.  It was dry and cubed, like it had come from a warehouse already prepared.  Even the soft tacos were inedible.  And how can you possibly screw up chicken soft tacos?!

The sides were also incredibly dissapointing.  Open up a can of Bush's pinto beans, pour it on a plate, and you have Adobe Reds ""beans"" side dish.  The rice had the odd skunky taste that made the rest of the food inedible.  The honey slaw tasted like cole slaw from Shop N' Save with some honey mixed in.

A cooler full cans and a wall of bottles was the main event, and had plenty for me to grab to take home to share with friends. A clipboard near the wall had detailed descriptions of everything, and there were a few taps pouring samples at the register.

My experience was pretty much ""grab and go"" so there's not much more to be said, but it was certainly pleasant and professional.",3.9076923076923076,3.75,neutral,13

But I was also ultimately happy because, between the uncanny draw of their special beer releases, and how niche & artsy the overall aspect of their merchandise is, it was something that made a lot of sense for them. Whenever I set foot into Fermenteria or Brew Cafe, I've always been enamored by the unique tshirts, hoodies, and glassware that I saw staring at me from the shelving and rafters. But in the busy restaurant and brewpub setting that almost always managed to become an afterthought for me.

That afterthought didn't happen to me as soon as I walked into the General Store, and came across t-shirts that I contemplated buying for OVER a year, coffee mugs alongside the Awake Minds coffee that Reanimator brews for them, ALL THE ARTISTIC GLASSWARE, and then some. So seeing all of those things brought to the forefront in this setting is obviously what the store is all about, and for that it definitely delivered a win.

If you've read my other reviews, followed my UnTappd checkins, or attended any of the the UYEs that I've hosted (5.0 coming in TBD 2018!), then you may know Tired Hands as a serious beer haven. But, while I may have seen a sampling of it when I looked upon their shelving and beer coolers, I also saw a lot to be desired compared to what I've indulged upon within either of their bars. True this may have been because I was there on Black Friday when every other beer store was winning out on Goose Island Bourbon Barrel Stouts. But still I expected to see more than their their standard beers like Hop Hands and Trendler Alt represented in their cans, and didn't see too many standout bottles this time around.

But still, with an ever changing lineup of forward thinking beers, and their main home brewery just a few blocks away, I expect to see this change upon other visits, and at least walk out with another bad ass t-shirt in the process.",3.9076923076923076,2.83,neutral,13

For those in the Philly and Ardmore areas, I really envy the fact that Tired Hands is in your backyard. Tired Hands has amazing beer and it definitely lives up to the hype. If you're like a lot of craft beer nerds and need to add yet another brewery shirt to the wardrobe and another pint glass to the collection, you'll have the full selection at the Tired Hands General Store.

After having some brews at the Fermentaria, make the three minute or so walk over to the General Store for your merch. The Fermentaria also has beer to go, but in case you forget to get some there, you can always get some here.

It's a small little shop, but it's definitely got more merchandise that I've seen at most other breweries, so there's a good selection for just about anybody. Shirts start at $20, which is about standard for almost brewery, and they aren't the cheap t shirt material either.

There's no limit on beer to go, and there's a No Limit Records picture posted right on the fridge to let you know that you get as much as you want. Service is great and I have no complaints about the staff.",3.9076923076923076,3.6100000000000003,neutral,13

There is no pressure in buying anything here. The fact that they sell cool Tired Hands logo shirts here, it's so...enticing to buy because they all look pretty cool to wear. They have a lot of large bottled beer, mostly or all dry types of beer I believe. They have their signature canned beers in the fridge, easily available to grab. Sometimes if they have released some new canned beers, they'll have it in the fridge too, but check out their website to see if they are available in store because they only seem to carry a certain amount and then when it's gone... it's gone until they make more at another time. Wouldn't say they'd make it the next few weeks, the make different stuff every time. 
The cashier that was there was very chill and nice, was welcoming. I used to be afraid to come into the store because I'm not huge of drinking alcohol, period, as I'm actually unable to really tolerate any (life, I know.

I've been anxiously awaiting for this new spot to open and finally got to try it. I work close by and a friend and I decided to pop in. It was early and the bar was pretty full. Luckily, we were able to snag the last two stools. I am a beer drinker and had the IPA on draft. Can't recall what it was, but it was cold and delicious! My co-worker had the Spicy Bee and raved about it. She loves a little spice (food and drink) and wouldn't stop talking about it. On to the food, we shared a few appetizers. The hushpuppies were awesome and a good size. I haven't had hushpuppies in years and this brought back great memories. The orange honey was the exact sweetness it needed and brought the dish together perfectly. Next, the crispy pork belly was heaven. I am a sucker for pork bell and the glaze added the most amazing sweetness. This was hands down the best pork belly dish that I've ever had. Now my co-worker isn't a meat eater, but will occasionally eat fish...so I guess a pescatarian. Now I am not a big fish eater and quite frankly don't ever like it when I try it. Well, that has changed. The smoked trout toast was INSANELY amazing. I can't even explain how good this is. I don't like fish and I would order this again and again and again. My co-worker thought the same thing and we ended up ordering another order. I was getting pretty full at this point after a few beers and the appetizers, but my co-worker wanted the pasta dish.  She ordered the Bucatini and was obsessed. I am not a huge mushroom fan, but took a taste and let me tell you that was some fresh on point pasta. The cheese gave it a really nice sauce and the pop of rosemary was really complimentary. I am looking forward to getting back soon and trying some of the entrees. The ambiance is really nice. It is soft, fresh and clean. Loved the fresh flowers and bud vases scattered throughout. It isn't a huge space, but configured really well. Great atmosphere for an intimate dinner or with a group. The staff was super friendly, very warm and inviting. The bartender Sam was pleasant and offered great conversation. He never left our drinks empty and was attentive. The hostess/manager? was really sweet. I think her name was Caitlyn or Katie and she welcomed us and help us snag the last two bar stools. She was constantly smiling and running around the restaurant assisting everyone and everything. Kudos to this new spot in Conshy. I can't wait to go back. Yes, it's a higher price point compared to a baggataway or gypsy, but you get what you pay for. Once you have the food, you'll understand. If you want good wings etc. go to baggataway. If you want a strange atmosphere with mediocre food, go up the street to gypsy. So excited to have this new place in the neighborhood.",3.598,3.5,neutral,15

One was a spicy ketchup and the other a tangy ranch. Dip your sliders into these puppies, they give you plenty! Could have been a few more fries for the price but we did get $2 off.

Of all the flavors I've had here (cherry, grape, lemon, blueberry, lime, to name a few) I don't think I've found anywhere else that has ""Tutti Frutti.""

I really do have fond memories of this place though. My relationship with my father turned sour a long time ago, but in the early years when we hung out as father and son this was one place I could ask him to take me and he wouldn't refuse.

They lacked the flavor of better ribs, and the sauces consumed the flavor -- preventing the meat to shine. 

Okay, with that being said, the fish is fantastic. I got the catfish with onion, mustard, pickles, and hot sauce. It is served as a sandwich on white bread. Wow! The fish is cooked to perfection. The batter is peppery and complements the fish perfectly. This drive-up dive does fried fish  better than anyone else.

I came home with a sampling and they were wonderful. A fantastic little shop which is easy to locate. A second location is situated on 97 St in Chinatown. Both locations have been in place for a very long time, I wonder if they would open a new location in Burnaby...",3.105625,3.88,neutral,16

However, the number one reason I have always gone to the Italian Bakery is for their custom made sandwiches... your choice of 2 meats and one cheese from their fantastic selection of meats and cheeses is now done for.  Apparently, now you have to order the day before, where we always used to go... hey, I'm in the area today, let's go to the Italian Bakery for lunch.

Now, going in to the Italian Bakery you have 2 choices... take the pre-made sandwiches (which often have stuff on them I do not want) or plan at least a day in advance.

Today I went in planning on buying custom sandwiches and bakery items, but with the new process, I had to cut out two thirds of my order.  And this was after driving from St. Albert into Edmonton (118th Ave location), because it was one of the last places to still make custom sandwiches.  Alas... no more.

I went on their website before actually deciding to go here (my parents had a gift certificate, which is really the only reason we were there) and it said that they had a new menu.  I looked at the menu and it seemed to be a big improvement over the previous one (with the addition of wood fired pizzas, etc.) so we decided to go.  Big mistake.

Our waiter was a strange russian man.  He didn't even give us menus until about ten minutes after we were seated.  He came up asked us what drinks we wanted (we didnt have menus) and then realized we didnt have menus and quickly got them for us.  He then brough us italian bread (best part of meal).  As we looked at the menu, he walked by with a Salmon special, put in under my girlfriend's nose and said ""Dis iz our salmon special"".  We were never properly told the specials.  He just was delivering one to another table and let my girlfriend smell it.  It was one of the more bizarre things i've ever experienced.

My father ordered an appetizer plate, which wasn't very good.  It had two shrimp, two mozzarella sticks, bruschetta and calimari.  The calimari was primarily the heads and tentacle of the squid, which sucked.

Our entrees came.  They sucked as well.  I got the fra diavolo.  It sucked.  Everything sucked.  It was one of the worst meals I've ever had in my entire life, and I lived in Haiti for two weeks, so that is saying something.

However I didn't back out and the food tasted fine and there were no issues and the fact the manager was Russian is completely irrelevent after the meal.

I never thought I would say this about a pharmacy, but the S. Carrollton CVS has such a nice vibe.

First of all, I don't think I have ever encountered a line at the pharmacy counter at this location.  The long lines full of grumpy people (including me) were one thing that I hated about going to the pharmacy at my old location.

Second of all, the people at the pharmacy counter (and at the regular counter) are so nice and helpful.  Maybe this is because they are not constantly being bombarded with people and so are in a better mood, but they are actually very pleasant, and I genuinely enjoy interacting with them.

The downsides to this pharmacy are: no public bathroom, not 24-hours, tricky location to access because of S. Carrollton/I-10 traffic.

The fountain drink area's sticky all over. The staff is indifferent (which is at least better than rude). But I'll be back. They know I will, cuz they don't mess up my order.

Food (5/5) -
You know what you will be getting when you come here. A 6-12' sub, with a choice of toppings and breads. 

Ambiance (4/5) -
Again, it's Subway. It's not spectacularly clean, but it's not messy either. The baked bread smell sometimes overpowers however. Not sure if they lack proper ventilation, but it has earned the nickname Smellway. But I guess if I had to choose between overpowering smells, I'd choose baked bread over, let's say, poop.

Service (5/5)
I love the service at this particular one. There is another Subway 4 minutes closer to my house, but I will come to this one because they are much more efficient. I have found service at other branches to be slow compared to here. Staff is always friendly. THE fastest subway sandwich maker in the world worked at this location for like 5 years! How cool is that. 

Total Impression (4/5) - 
I am a regular here and will always be as long as they remain as efficient as they have been.",3.099375,4.18,positive,16

So for people who are gluten-free were looking for those breakfast items like waffles pancakes and French toast I would definitely recommend this place as a breakfast spot.

Our meal for the event was lasagna, salad, bun and cake for dessert.

The food was fantastic and I really liked the lasagna, and it was a very sizeable portion as well.  As a non-celiac I was very happy with the meal and I don't think anyone would have known the difference that it was gluten-free if they were given the food without the knowledge of where it is from.

They also have a small store area where you can pick-up some gluten-free items.

The one downside to this place is that it is really hidden within the Strathcona Mini-Mall (where Dawaat is).  I guess being a specialty shop Celiacs and gluten-free people would seek it out though.  I think it would be great if it was more out in the open and had a name other than ""Gluten Free"" Diner.

My friend with celiac says it's the only place in town that she can reliably go, eat anything, and not worry about contamination or having a reaction.  They also sell gluten free products and pre-made dishes in the front.

Well, as non-celiacs, my friends and I loved the food and couldn't tell at all that it was gluten-free!  The potato pancakes, crepes and waffles all got raves from our party.  It was seriously moist and flavourful.  Service was prompt, and even though they warned us that things would be slow since there was only once chef, our food came out within a reasonable time.  They are mostly open for Breakfast/Brunch, but open for dinner on Saturday nights - in which the breakfast menu is still served :) - there are a few lunch type entrees that are more dinner-like but no additional dinner menu.  They take reservations, and I definitely recommend one if you're coming for brunch.

One star off because of the location - it is in a somewhat sketchy old strip mall just east of the main strip on Whyte.  Same mall as Dawaat, but you have to go inside the mall to access the restaurant.  It can get quite hot and stuffy in there, not optimally ventilated.  There is free parking in the back alley.  The bathroom is a communal bathroom for the whole strip mall... and it's not maintained very well (I know this is no fault of the GF diner, but it detracts from the whole experience).  When I went, there was Indian food puke in the next sink.  appetizing.

Despite this, the food was great and I wouldn't hesitate to return with anyone else who wants to eat a gluten-free meal!",3.3185714285714285,2.8899999999999997,neutral,14

GF Diner is hidden away inside of a little strip mall on Whyte, inside where the Dawatt and Cleo nails are. The store front offers plenty of packaged gluten free items, like pasta / cake mix, as well as frozen meals. 

The atmosphere of the diner is nice - very vintage esque - and they play some awesome music. The menu has a pretty decent spread of breakfast and lunch items to chose from. The chips served with their sandwiches are so, so good! Try them out! I got the BLT, and the lack of gluten definitely does not make any type of impact on the flavour of the food. 

The only reason I took a star off was because of the portion sizing. I was still left hungry at the end of my meal. Despite that, it's an awesome place to check out for some brunch action. (Just be prepared to snack soon-ish afterwards).",3.3185714285714285,3.16,neutral,14

Last night, I didn't want to make dinner (fighting cold/flu of doomiest doom). I told the boss he'd need to pick up dinner if he didn't want leftovers. After I broke his poor little heart with the revelation that his go-to takeout at PF Chang's--kung pao chicken and pork fried rice--was as bad for him as eating four quarter-pounders with cheese in one sitting, he decided to hit up Royal Thai for takeout. Phad Thai. (I opted for Wendy's. That's how gross I think Royal Thai is. And don't even get me started on what I think of freaking PF Chang's.)

The phad Thai was terrible. I didn't actually try it, but it looked and smelled disgusting. And trust me when I say that my husband has not found many versions of phad Thai he'll turn his back on. He dumped the entire gloppy, smelly, oogy mess in the trash and ate Ruffles and Honey Bunches of Oats instead. $16.95 in the trash!

My previous experiences with Royal Thai have been no better, so I feel pretty safe in giving this joint two stars.

SOOO at first i laughed, then i began to get irritated once he closed the window and began to walk away is when i believed that he was really gonna be an a*% about it!

The owners of this cafe have the space a major face lift. The beautiful Saltillo tiles give it a 4th ave appropriate vibe. There are paintings by local artists on the walls-- next time I go I'll be sure to add photos. 

It is bright inside-- so don't expect the mood light ambiance of, say, a Savaya coffee. There are lots of small tables for two. They play music I wasn't expecting-- kind of a mix of old and new punk and pop. Hard to describe. 

The person I've ordered from both times-- probably the owner-- is very accommodating and helpful! He is proud of what they are doing with that cafe-- as he should be! The coffee really is terrific!

The hours are the only thing keeping me from going more often. I believe on weekdays he closes at 1. Even so, my coworker-- who is also a big fan-- and I try to plan time in our workweek to get out there. 

I ordered an iced latte with 2 shots of the delicious Guatemalan espresso and oat milk the first time. And the same, but hot the second time. The espresso was so smooth! The chai was perfect. Together it made for the most delicious, comforting drink ever. 

And the prices are SO low! Honestly, I couldn't believe my order came out to so little considering I added two espresso shots. The bagged coffee is also incredibly low priced. I expected it to be so much more. The entire experience and quality was entirely superior to my experience at Savaya coffee and it was significantly, way cheaper. 

I absolutely recommend checking this place out next time you want a lunchtime coffee. And grab a bag of that Guatemalan coffee while you're there. It's scrumptious.

They have a nice array of menu items, which include traditional items, as well as some of the more ""coffee aficionado"" choices you'd expect to find in the ""serious"" coffeehouses.  

Their coffee and espresso are bold and rich, without having any flavor gimmicks that I've found at other coffee shops that turn me off.  I don't need some weird flavor in the beans that takes over and beats you over the head, I just need a coffee that can stand on its own.  That's what Mission is serving.  I like that they offer dairy-free milk alternatives at no additional cost, and their almond milk is unsweetened.  I don't like unnecessary sweeteners messing with the flavor of my coffee, so this is a big score for me.  As for sugar, for items like the Cubano, which is traditionally made with sugar (to taste), they will gladly use a sugar alternative.  

But if you like sugar, they've got the goods for you, too, including the wildly popular chai tea.  It's very good, but Mission's coffee is just too good for me to pass up.  They also have Italian sodas and other tea varieties for those of you who don't do coffee.  There's something for everyone!

I've been digging their cold brew on these hot summer days.  I only order the largest size, and I like that it isn't just a cup full of ice.  I don't feel ripped off, which some places will do to you with cold brews.  Anyway, I'll probably switch to the Cubano or just a regular drip when the cold weather comes.

The shop is cozy, quaint, welcoming, and clean.  I really like the vibe, I think they've done a good job with the local art to make it a nice atmosphere.  All the employees have been really kind to us.  We even chatted with the owner last week, and he was super cool too.  I think Mission's prices are totally fair for the quality they're serving.  I would say they probably have the best prices (or close to them) in town as far as local coffee shops go.

If I have one gripe it's that I wish they were open an hour longer on Saturday nights.  I'm often 10-20 minutes too late due to my schedule, and that always bums me out!  6pm just seems too early on what should be the ""busy"" night on the ave. But I'm such a fan, that I've actually skipped things on my night's agenda just to make sure I get to Mission before closing!  Hard to do sometimes, though.

All-in-all, I would definitely recommend Mission Coffee to everyone.  It's good stuff!",4.458,4.63,positive,15

Albert's also have a full menu for lunch and dinner and includes your basic items like burgers, sandwiches, salad and homestyle dinners. I haven't had a bad meal here, but again, you can't expect fine dining.

I was excited to see another restaurant open on the Southside and I crossed my fingers very tightly in hopes that it would be a good one... And it must have worked! Because it's better than I expected!

We went two days after their grand opening on a late Friday evening, and the place was packed - but we were still able to be seated immediately. The restaurant is huge! Lots of table and lots of staff! (I hate when restaurants understaff, and this was certainly not an issue here!)

Our service was superior! He was attentive, quick, and accurate in all our requests. Our drinks were refilled and our plates were cleared once we were done. VERY impressed. (Coming from a long time server, that's a great compliment!)

The menu was very extensive, and I couldn't believe how cheap everything was! There was also a large vegetarian section, which of course made me happy! We each ordered combos, and had a basket of complimentary chips and salsa. The food was very good - not the most amazing Mexican food I've had, but very good! 

For alcohol selection, they had spirits, beer, wine, and margaritas. Margaritas start at just $4.25!!! (Yes, jaw drop.) And glasses of wine are only $2.99! (Try not to pass out.)

Afterwards, (somehow that I can't understand) my boyfriend made room for dessert - and ordered the churros. WOW. Let's just say those bad boys should be illegal, they were so tasty! Highly recommend getting those!

Our total came out to $30, for 2 drinks, 2 dinners, and a dessert! You CANNOT beat that!

They were clearly under staffed, as the hostess was also the table buster. We watched several customers come in and stand at the hostess stand waiting for several minutes because she was in the back cleaning tables.

- Each person gets their own salsa bowl. This is a small detail that I always like!

- VERY affordable prices! Among some of the cheapest I've seen 

The not so good: 
- Service was kind of rough. Even though it was s Friday night, they weren't unreasonably busy. The server took too long to check in on us throughout the entire dinner experience. 
- I love me a big and delicious margarita. Their ""jumbo"" margarita was on special (I think like 6 bucks on Fridays?). It's a good size, but not big enough to be considered a jumbo.

The first time I tasted her work, I remarked that ""She NEEDS to open a bakery!!"" Turns out, I was one of several thousand who told her this, and heard she was planning to do this at some point in the future.

The future has arrived, and I was in Heaven on opening day, after trying her Carrot Cake, and Linzer cookies. I was never a fan of Carrot cake. They all seemed dry, and most icing was so sweet, you couldn't enjoy it. This is now my favorite cake.

The cake is the perfect balance of tasty, moist cake, and the icing is spot-on. The Linzers were the best texture, most soft, flawless blend of flours, and a home-made center jelly I've ever eaten.

We don't live close, but after the pure enjoyment we experienced, we will be returning to try the other goodies.

I go to a place near by often and saw their grand opening sign. I am a fan of gyro's and came here to get one. Instead I got a dinner to go.

As I walked in, I was impressed by the place. They did a nice job designing the tables and decor. Having just driven from work, I had to use the restroom. It was clean which is a good sign. 

I checked the reviews already on here while I looked over the menu. Once I saw the seafood platter I knew I wanted that. It was very good, with a couple suggestions for them. (see photos for a picture of the dish)

The dish came with a nice size piece of tilapia, 7 grilled shrimp, and 4 scallops, pasta and a piece of bread for $15. Which is a good amount in my opinion. The shrimp were great, nicely seasoned. Not sure what the seasoning was but it had a very little kick which I enjoyed. The scallops could have been seared a little bit more, but they we not bad. The fish could have used a little more seasoning, but again overall is was moist and not overcooked. Which is easy to do.

The pasta was great. It was tossed in a olive oil sauce with chopped garlic and scallions. I wish the menu stated it had scallions, as I am not a fan, but I easily picked them out. Next time I know better. 

I look forward to trying more items from here like their Zesty Wings, Smoked Salmon, and Gyro's.

My wife was a bit skeptical and rejected every attempt to suggest here. Well, she finally caved and we made it here. For the most part, it was worth the wait.

The restaurant, when I walked in, was noticeably clean. The floors were shiny and the tables all wiped down. The restaurant area was mostly empty, save for one small family. But the take-out section had a steady flow of traffic. The waitress greeted us instantly and said we could sit at a space of our choosing. Immediately we were given menus and asked for drinks. We placed our drink orders and perused the menu. The menu had a lot of interesting items on it, but wasn't so large as to be overwhelming. The waitress came back with our drinks and offered the daily special, as well as explaining some of the items on the menu.

After thinking it over, we ordered salads and an appetizer of the Chicken Samosa to get us started. I ordered the Chicken Kofta and my wife ordered the Mumtaz Gosht. The salads came out quickly and were serviceable with a nice yogurt and garlic dressing. After a bit we received our Samosa, and that turned out to be quite delicious. It came with two dipping sauces that I wound up spooning and eating after the Samosa was finished. 

The entrees themselves were beautifully plated. The Chicken Kofta came with a large slice of their house bread, as well as a large portion of Persian Rice. The Mumtaz Gosht consisted of a large lamb shank as well as bread a Persian Rice. Immediately we could tell that this was going to be something special. The Kofta's were a delicious mix of the chicken and filling among a slightly tangy tomato and garlic based sauce. The lamb shank on the Mumtaz Gosht was some of the most tender lamb I have ever tasted. It came clean off the bone and simply melted the moment you put it in your mouth. If all you had was a plastic spoon, that would have sufficed. It was that tender. It was a meal that both my wife and I haven't stopped thinking about since we left.

there was a slight mix up as our food came out, where my wife's dish went to another table. So I sat with a plate full of food for a bit while my wife waited. However, the waitress apologized profusely and took care of us when the bill came. I only mention to show that even if a mistake was made, the staff here went above and beyond to correct the mistake and ensure we had a pleasant experience.

The meal this time pushed the place to a 5-star for me. The dinner was started off with their Bolanee Gandana, a deep fried turnover filled with all kinds of good stuff. 

I tried the lamb shank this time with a side of the Banjan Eggplant. As my wife's lamb was last time we visited, my lamb was amazingly tender. So much so that I easily picked it down to the bone, enjoying every bite. The real surprise was the Banjan Eggplant. Caught me completely off guard and I couldn't believe this was eggplant. 

My wife is now a big fan of the place. She had the Lamb Gyro, something she had never tried before. The lamb here was also extremely delicious, which by now shouldn't be surprising. Many places tend to have extremely dry lamb in their gyro sandwiches, with the lamb sitting far too long. But that was definitely not the case here as I couldn't help but sneak a few bites for myself. 

The place was fairly busy when I went in this time. But service was fast, drinks were always full and our dishes came out beautifully plated and piping hot.

I ordered the salmon kabob, my father got the beef, and my mother got the chicken.  The chicken was my favorite out of the 3 and the beef came in a close 2nd, although neither of them totally wowed me.  Maybe I had high expectations because I was sadly disappointed.  Not in a dramatic way since the food was ""A-OK,"" but in a ""Spiderman 3 is going to be SICKKK"" kind of way.  The bread and dipping sauces, on the other hand, pleasantly surprised me in a ""What's Shawshank Redemption? Sure, I guess I'll watch it..."" kind of way.

To clarify, my experience at Jahan Kabob was simply average. The restaurant was essentially empty when I sat down for dinner, its decor however was clean and modern, which was a plus. Our waitress arrived in a dirty-ish shirt and didn't seem to know too much about the menu, which was a negative. She was accommodating and quick, however, which redeemed things.

Anyways, the food, as I said, was decent. I opted for a smoked lamb gyro with fries. Unfortunately, the gyros here are of the pressed, ground-meat variety rather than the layered-meat-slice variety you see at Turkish spots, so the meat ended up being obligatorily spongy. However, the meat exhibited good spicing and the tzatziki sauce was flavorful. The pita was unfortunately store bought, but the fries, though prefrozen, were crispy and seasoned well. My vegetable samosa was fresh with a very flaky pastry shell that wasn't greasy at all. The sauces (both green and white) that came with it were stellar, and I ended up slathering these on everything. Prices were somewhat steep ($10 for the gyro and fries, $5 for the small samosa).

I'll probably return to Jahan Kabob, but that speaks more to the lack of Middle-Eastern/Mediterranean options in the area. Their more authentic and special fare seems quite appealing, but I'll keep on looking for a solid gyro spot.",3.247777777777778,2.04,neutral,18

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the lack of ambiance and no wine or beer.  
We are definitely going back!",3.9493333333333336,3.0,neutral,15

They serve .... hands down .... THE BEST OYSTER STEW I have ever tasted!   Milk, butter, and huge oysters flavored with smokey bacon, salt and pepper.   A very generous portion with enough to take home.  We also tried a meal of fried oysters and shrimp served with freshly made chips.  The seafood is fresh and cooked to perfection.  All the fish options (not pasta) are served with a side of freshly cut and made potato chips that are really yummy, not greasy and great flavor.  There  are pasta options with seafood in either a red sauce or a white Alfredo sauce.   Also, a marinara option for those who don't eat seafood or fish.   Seems like the fish and chips are a big favorite as they were flying out as fast as they could prepare them.   Service is promot and courteous.  Ambiance is truly the desert so be kind.  We are about good food!  If you want upscale, make another choice.  You want tasty seafood or fish at a fair price... this is the place.  Truly a gem in the western flats of Tucson.

Because I had hope, I guess, wishful thinking.

Don't get me wrong, the food was fresh and there was nothing bad, but it certainly wasn't anything more than what I could have whipped up in 30 minutes or less at home.  It's the type of place that you would rely on to cook for you when you just don't feel like cooking yourself.  But then again I'm a snob, ask any of my ex's.

And, it's the type of place when you ask for salad dressing on the side, it comes in a plastic take-out container.  The roll served with the salad was a small hoagie roll cut in half.  The seasoned olive oil was semi-flavorful, thanks to the seasoning, not the quality of the oil.

We split mussels to start.  The broth was thin and weak, the mussels tiny, but they were fresh and edible.  The chicken and broccoli and the chicken piccata were basically good, nothing bad in there.

DO NOT ORDER the veal parmigiana. Veal medallions are to be thin, tender and lightly breaded. All good Italian restaurants know that. Veal is to be pounded and tenderized if it is on the thicker side. Veal is pounded with a meat tenderizer mallet. Not this SLAB ! It was thicker that a combat boot heel and tougher than a steel belted radial. Rough tendons and stringy running thru it. Very hard to cut with a knife and harder to chew, maybe it wasn't veal. Good veal done right can be cut with a fork. Pretty tasteless at that. One end of the slab was burnt and overcooked and inedible. Dog wouldn't eat it. Also came with bow tie pasta, over a pound with one small dip of sauce, nowhere near enough sauce for that amount and long pasta should have been included such as linguini, thin spaghetti or fettuccini. If i wanted bow tie i would have ordered pasta salad. $24 was way over-priced for this meal. Now I have eaten at this restaurant over 100 times over the years (when it was Brazzo), always a good meal. Maybe one not satisfactory over the years. We have had birthdays, anniversaries, going away to college dinners, etc. I used to recommend Brazzo over the years to everyone Then I said jokingly why am i telling everyone about this secret, maybe it will get so popular i won't be able to get in. Brazzo used to stack up against any Italian restaurant in the Buxmont area. Now I know it was sold and most things would be kept the same for the last year or so. And it was somewhat. I have probably eaten here since its been sold 8-10 times. Food has always been satisfactory. But last 1-2 times something is off or different. Has it been sold again or is someone else running the kitchen?

I attended quite a few events in Philadelphia over the past year and Flavors of the Avenue was one of the best. This happened last April and yes, I am already anxiously awaiting their return. The venue was perfect, under a tent, so it was rain or shine, but it was a glorious day. Indoor tables to stand around, munch and chat with folks and outdoor patio seating and live music fills the air.

Twenty, plus restaurants had samplings of their best selling foods, ranging from sandwich samplings, to soups, to breakfast entrees, side dishes, desserts and I even got to try tripe. Not only did I try tripe, but I loved it and went back for more, then when I found out what I was loving so much... Well, let's put it this way, next time I shall ask more questions.

The mushroom tacos were outstanding, I also really enjoyed the spring pea soup, I returned several times for stuffed Tasso ham sandwich bites and bacon mac & cheese, while hubby pigged out on the duck prosciutto, yes I was loving it too! Mama Maria's served up an awesome gorganzola pasta with artichokes and veal, I asked them to hold the veal, as I do not eat it and if you don't try the curry chicken waffles then I will scream at you, fool! I could go on and on, what a tremendous hit this event was, is and will be in the upcoming years!.  

VIP tickets were $50.00 each, early booking discounts lower this, but get you in at noon, which is one hour prior to the mad herd of folks coming in to chow down on delicious nibbles of every range of culinary delights. It also gets you specialty cocktails, wine and beer.  $30.00 tickets gets you in an hour later and includes wine and beer samplings.  

Flavors of the Avenue is about to happen again, on April 28 and you can be guaranteed to find me there! I'll be the VIP drinking the specialty cocktails, wines and eating anything but tripe.",3.1453333333333333,4.42,positive,15

I have never eaten dinner at an East Passyunk restaurant and I don't even deserve to call myself a foodie. I'm sorry I let you down, Yelp world. 

I've been trying though! A few weeks ago I went to the party at the Singing Fountain for East Passyunk Ave being named a Top 10 Foodie Street in America. I was awed and overwhelmed. Today, at the Flavors of the Avenue Event, I was even more awed, more overwhelmed, more sated, more tipsy, and yearning more than ever to accept my inevitable fate as a fat, broke, happy person who has tried every restaurant on this street.

I went with the early bird regular price ticket ($25) and my friend and I agreed that it was money very well spent and totally worth it. See you next year Flavors of the Ave.

We rushed from table to table like crazed adult trick or treaters grabbing cups of meatballs, plates (and more plates) of Pâté (Fond), cups of cold green soup (Izumi, Will BYOB, Fuel), rabbit terrine and sesame ginger macarons (the clear winners, courtesy of Stateside), hefty helpings of pasta (Mamma Maria's), delicious tacos (El Zarape), risotto balls and watermelon feta salad (close second place, by Noir), mussels, short rib ravioli (Birra). Drinks were flowing too, with wine, beer, and margaritas (peach and plain-from Cantina). 

Lines were not too long with the exception of margaritas and tacos, and even those weren't bad at all. Next year, my only suggestion would be maybe make sure to leave lots of room for lines and avoid placing popular spots in the corners?

It was a gorgeous day, great festival, and it was great to stand outside sampling (at times surprisingly large) portions of some of the best restaurants in the city not to mention generously poured drinks.

I'm a wanna-be foodie (read: too poor at the moment to really be a foodie), and the only restaurant I have been to on Passyunk yet (not for lack of wanting to try them all) is WILL, which is amazing on its own right... these two factors made me VERY excited to come to the Flavors of the Avenue. I don't really have a bad thing to say about this, so if you want to know why it was so great you can keep reading... 
1. The price: only $25 for non vip entry, lasts 1-4 which is more than enough time to gorge yourself on the food, get mildy (or more if you aren't driving) buzzed, and enjoy the day. 
2. I have been to other tasting events and they ran out of food, we left for a little and came back around 3:30 and every table still had tons.  
3. Portion sizes, a few places it was just a ""sample size"" bite or two, but most  of the stands were giving huge portions for a tasting. Mama Mia's was handing out a heaping plate of pasta, El Zarape's tacos were full and dripping with spicy goodness, the short rib raviolo from Birra was, I swear, a portion size (no complaints here) 
4. The drinks, if you have read my past posts, its no surprise I was happy that the wine, beer and margaritas were flowing, delicious and easy to get to. 
5. ALL of the food was great! I was somewhat disappointed with fishy tuna, cheesesteak eggrolls, or the sandwich from Nord. The rabbit terrine and macarons from Stateside were the winners, the terrine mixed so many flavors so well. I also loved the risotto balls, the short rib ravioli (whats not to like there) from Birra), the boar  fois gras on toasts, and WILL's soup all stood out... 
6. Lines weren't too bad, there was maybe a half hour where it felt very packed, but never waited more than 5-7 minutes, and everyone was so friendly they welcomed sharing tables. 
The only thing I can complain about is that I couldn't find any  more room in my stomach to grab a second helping of my favorites...",3.1453333333333333,3.74,neutral,15

I grabbed one anyway and filled him up pretty good.  I tried to make my money back in booze, but i just couldn't hack it with the crowds, and he was nearing a panic attack.  We gave it a whirl... but I think next time we'll take our $60 and invest in a nice dinner at one of the kajillions of restaurants that were there.  I don't think this type of events is for me.

Additionally, I salute you all with iron stomachs.  After eating cookies, cupcakes, a glass of wine, 2 beers, a margarita, eggplant rollatini, caprese, hummus, more cupcakes, and then this green soupy stuff, topped off with a bite of a salad I literally couldn't move for the rest of the day.

The drinks were flowing while enticing options from 25+ restaurant booths made me feel like Charlie in the Chocolate Factory.  Cantina unquestionably stole me. The margaritas and jalapeño tacos did not fail to impress.  Ippolito's ahi tuna cheesesteak spring roles took the lead for my favorite small plate there.

2013: Tough two to three stars. I had a vip wristband this year. The Vip hour was amazing. There were so many more restaurants with much more upscale kind of food than the first one. There was also a great variety of alcohol (including beer that wasn't there in 2011). It was easy to move around and grab food. Then the floodgates opened. All of a sudden I was pushed up against the table and the tent was like a sauna. We had to walk outside to cool off. The food tables were so crowded you couldn't even see what the offerings were. We left very early. We had our fill and were satisfied, but that is ONLY because we were there for the Vip hour. I feel like they either need to lose the tent and make it entirely outside or sell fewer bands. It was far too many people.

Getting there early to stand in line before the VIP hour ended was a MUST. We got in and grabbed drinks and headed to a few tables we thought might get mobbed right away & were thrilled. After a while, the place got *very* crowded. Not for those who don't deal well in close quarters. But by that point we'd made a good dent and our crew of 4 was adept at weaving through the crowds and hit every table.

Ms. Goody Cupcakes 'Nerd Cupcakes' with Nerd candy on top of their icing was so tasty, I brought a dozen of their cupcakes to work for a going away party today. So good!

Cantina's margaritas were a hit with our group - then again they always are. But neighboring El Zarape's tacos were excellent & earned them a spot on our 'must visit list.'

That's what the great thing was about this event! It was awesome to get a sneak peak at Noord (a few weekends before they even opened, no less!) and try some places we just haven't had a chance to get to! Noir impressed with a watermelon feta salad and several other offerings which are now a blur were also crazy good, like Stateside. Some places were even giving out coupons, which was really nice. 

Disappointing was the shad stew from Tre Scalini - a charming BYO on the lower end of Passyunk that never failed to utterly impress until this event and Birra's short rib ravioli tasted more like Chef Boyardee than the normal deliciousness I order there regularly - so luckily no newbies offered up anything I was disappointed with & I haven't lost faith in my old favorites.

There was also a private indoor/outdoor tent, more tables, lots of alcohol available (with no lines) throughout the entire event. 

This event was a great way for me to sample dishes from EPA restaurants. The restaurants provided small bites of one or two dishes from the restaurant.  I mostly got my food fill during the VIP hour so the lines were not very long. My friend and I would divide and conquer...we would each go to a few different lines and bring the food back at a table to chow down. It pretty much was every man for himself. Tables were not hard to find as everyone was friendly and willing to share their space. By 3:15 a lot of the restaurants had run out of food and they were packing up. Some of my food highlights include cupcakes from Ms. Goody Cupcake, margaritas from Cantinas, watermelon feta salad from Noir, pizza from Stogie Joe's, gnocchi from Mama Maria and raw oysters (maybe from Paradiso? I can't remember..)

After the VIP hour my friend and I headed to the outdoor portion VIP tent. With the warm sun, live music on Yunk and cucumber margaritas I felt like I had gone to South Philly heaven. It was nice to provide an outdoor area for participants to enjoy since it was such a nice day!

Why? Well. Mostly because I had never been to ANY of the places before. This South Jersian has neglected South Philly terribly. It had to be fixed. 

The comped VIP tickets thanks to Yelp were amazing to have, too, as they gave us an extra hour to try everything before it got *really* crowded, plus I got to use Uber for the first time -- for free, thanks to the event's promo code.

Birra and Lucky 13 especially wowed me with their offerings. Birra had a sweet pork rib and a bread pudding. Both were delicious! As for Lucky 13? Well, they served up my favorite spirit, and in the most random but fantastic way: tarragon black pepper gin fizz. What in the heck. Perfection.

Oh, and who can forget Ms. Goody's tequila and kahlua cupcakes? Or Cantina's margaritas?

In the VIP drink tent: Pinnacle's peach vodka cocktail was the standout. Also liked Sly Fox's offerings.

Aside: Yes, that was a lot of midday mixing! But so worth the potential headache -- which did not occur, phewf!

VIP entrance to the event began at 12 PM, and regular admission at 1 PM. Valet parking was included with the VIP ticket, but could be purchased for $12 with regular admission. The parking attendants were great- super friendly and quick. 

We arrived at East Passyunk super early, so we strolled around for a little checking out the local craft fair. We jumped into the line at 11:30 AM, which is where we picked up some sweet free Sailor Jerry T shirts. 

The line moved fast, when we got into the tent it was filled with delicious smelling and looking food. All the tables were set up surround the edges of the tent, and high cocktail tables were in the middle. 

Since it was our first time here, our only strategy was to eat as much as possible- while others had clearly planned ahead- reserving tables and splitting up to get different dishes to bring back to home base. Regardless of strategy- there was plenty of food to go around, and I think everyone ended up happy. 

EVERYTHING was delicious. Each and every restaurant brought their A game But, my favorite item of the entire day.... drum roll... the peanut butter mousse from Lucky 13 Pub. I also loved the pasta from Mamma Maria Ristorante and the sliders from POPE. My boyfriend and I have created an eating ""to-do"" list after discovering so many great East Passyunk restaurants. 

After 45 minutes in, we had tried almost everything and started to force ourselves to eat more. As general admission started entering, we headed outside the tent to enjoy the sun and local band set up in the middle of the street.  

The VIP ticket was awesome, not only did it give us the valet parking- but it was totally worth it for the early entrance. During this time there was hardly any crowd and special dishes for VIP tickets only. And there was a VIP tent which had additional drinks and seating. 

The event was well organized, and everyone who took part in it did a great job. I'll be on the look out for Flavors of the Avenue 2016.",3.1453333333333333,3.95,neutral,15

The event has been on my radar for a few years now but I hadn't gotten around to going.  Plus a few people I know had hyped up the event, but maybe a little too much.  Knowing I had to pick up my tickets at will call and being pre-warned there be a line I got there on the 11:35/11:40ish.  There was a line as expect but my friend and I were happy with our spot in it.  11:45 is right when it bust so if you want to be one of the 1st ones in get there before hand.

When we were finally let in just after 12:00 it seemed like a lot of vendors weren't quite ready.  So we aimed to try and hit up booth with food which made picking a starting spot and going booth to booth not really possibility.  But the VIP Crowd was reasonable and not too difficult to navigate so wasn't a huge issue.  Unfortunately the event was heavy on the pork which neither my friend nor I eat.  It was also heavy on the chicken liver which I tired but I'm also not a huge fan of.  If you are a vegetarian this is probably not the event for you there was very little vegetarian option well unless you are pescatrain and eat fish.

We basically were able to try almost everything with in the 1st 30 minutes.  Than we tasted some drink in and headed to the craft fair in hope by our return all the tables without food would have them.  By the time we got back they were letting the rest of the festival goers in.  At that point it was hard to move around but we were able to get back to the previously empty table and try there dish, more me than my friend since most were fish and she also doesn't eat fish.  

It was such a gorgeous day outside that we ended up finding a place in the VIP area to sit and just keep refilling our tiny cups with beverage samples while enjoying the sun.  But if it wasn't so gorgeous I'm sure we would have just left the festival.

We had the VIP experience and were able to enter an hour before general admission.  We arrived 30 minutes early and there was still a line of about 40 people in front of us waiting to get in.  Going early was clutch as we got to quickly get to a lot of the tables before lines formed.  A few tables were not ready at opening time, which was a bummer.  

It was cool to try bites from neighborhood restaurants all in one place.  Some of which often are a little harder to get reservations.  Chefs were on hand--I saw both Nick Elmi and Christopher Kearse, which is a cool personal touch you don't see at many other food festivals.

Boozy samples were small, but VIP gave us some options not available to general admission.  I noticed two tables also had VIP-specific food options.  The food mostly consisted of pate and liver or pork.  Guess all the chefs had the same idea.  This event is not vegetarian friendly--there were only a few dishes vegetarians could try (including a disappointingly-burned falafel ball from P.O.P.E.)

The craft fair which is separate and open to the public but held in conjunction with Flavors was awesome.  Vendors from up and down the east coast showed up with their wares.  I ended up spending $20 on soap because it smelled that good.",3.1453333333333333,2.18,neutral,15

When I won a VIP booklet I was very excited.

As a street festival I say it was much better than its pervious tent set up.  It was still crowded in some areas but there was much more space and you could find room.  If you got your eye on one or 2 places I'd say go for it.

But as for the booklet not sure its worth it.  Just like the tent style they ran out of food pretty fast in some location.  A few offered sub but many did not which was disappointing.  You get one of each item which is a lot of food but its very specific so if you don't eat something you could be out of luck.  I am not a pig product fan so my friends who came with me benefited from that and there were a lot of places serving pig products.

I'd consider going back alacart style if they keep the set up the way they had it this year but wouldn't recommend the VIP booklet.",3.1453333333333333,1.8600000000000003,negative,15

I only drink Bud when were out of everything else (including water).

That being said I really enjoy most of the beers I have tried from Buckbean. I'm more of a porter or dark beer kind of guy and would have to say that the Black Noddy is my favorite so far. The Orange Blossom is an everyperson kind of beer, especially for the ladies that like something crisp and a little fruity. I didn't care for the Scottish Ale but I don't really like any Scottish Ales in general. LOVE the IPA that recently came out; pale but not too pale. Overall the beer taste from the can isn't different from getting it from the tap, just tastes a little fresher from the tap.

I enjoy heading down there on a Friday after work and filling up my growler. (If you don't know what a ""growler"" is and you're a beer drinker, go check it out....NOW!) Basically it's a 64 oz. jug to fill up and reuse which is not only cost effective but environmentally friendly. If you're unsure of what beer to get they can hook you up with a couple of tasters first.  Everyone that I've met there is really nice and informational when it comes to beer and they really enjoy talking about their beer.

They have charity events such as dart tourneys every so often that I really want to check out soon. If you're really into your beer you can take a self guided tour or even if you have alot of people you can schedule a guided tour. (just ask them for details). There is a few placese to sit and chat while enjoying a beer, but unfortunatly they don't serve food...just mixed bowl snacks. That is the only drawback besides the hours. But if they are closed you can find the beer at a variety of pubs, bars, pizza places and at your local grocer.

I can't say really anything decent about their poor excuse for a beer because they are all swill. The Orange Blossom is far too sweet. The Black Noddy is supposedly a schwarzbier but tastes like slightly flavored tap water and the Tule Red tastes like kerosene. Now don't get me wrong, I have fine tastes in beer running the gamut from really like ales to super dark porters but Buckbean doesn't hit anything good about beer. I think the marketing has got them where they are but the product is horrible.

If you remember that the establishment is more of a distribution site than your typical Microbrewery restaurant, you'll like it.  They have a super naughty dark that's too strong for my taste.  I believe it's 11% and the alcohol is a bit overwhelming even considering it would be in the barley wine category.  Their most popular has to be their orange blossom.  It's good, but something in it gives me heartburn and I can't usually have more than one or two.  Probably just me.  I love the red they've come out with and that's what I drank tonight.  I can't remember the official name, but it's really good.  I've never tried the new IPA, and probably won't because I don't like really bitter beers.  One thing I really like is you can walk in and have a beer without having to wait hours for a seat or table like some of the other breweries in town.

I dropped into Reno for just 2 nights, to work an event, and had some down time, so, of course, Yelped some good beer.  Lo and behold, local Reno brewer, Buckbean Brewery.  (BTW, it is easy to miss, in a strip mall/warehouse, the address is on Rock, but go south of Rock on McCarron to easily find the Entrance.)

 The Orange Blossom Ale is a revelation.  Delicious.  Not to be confused with Oranjeboom or that swill known as Blue Moon, Orange Blossom is actually a delightful full-bodied ale, with a wonderful hint of Orange Blossom on the nose.  (Just to be clear, I can't stand fruit flavored beers, but this is only named after a flower.)  You can also get as many tastes as you want of each type (dangerous), and they sell 4-pack cans on sight (not sure if they will survive my checked bag).

Definitely worth the trip.
The only reason they don't get 5 stars is the lack of grub, (though Patti did bring me a microwave pizza, a bag of Kettle chips, and free popcorn; more than enough for a late lunch).

They can their beer.  OK.  They could pour their beer into filet mignon, wrap it in apple smoked bacon and deep fry it, and the whole thing would still leave me searching for my Boston Terriers ass to lick only to get the taste of their schwill off my tongue.  I could take a dump into an aluminum can, and it would still just be a can full of shit.

Their two staples, which I've had off and on throughout the past few years since they opened doors in Reno in 2007, were relatively flat, unbalanced and pedestrian in flavor.  Orange Blossom and some red ale named after a duck.  I couldn't tell the difference, the experience was too close to drinking a glass of tap water.

So I was reluctant when my girl told me she had a growler coupon to cash in there.  It was a good deal and I was short on cash for my weekend buzz so I quiesced.  My past experience interacting w/ Dan Kahn and a few other folks there has been an attitude of aloof condensation and so I didn't have high hopes for personality, but I did want my growlers filled for cheap so I was willing to tolerate it.

The bartender this Friday apparently made a point of not dispelling my preconceived prejudice against Buckbean.  He was vapid and distracted, and knew nothing about the beer he was serving.  The further events were uneventful... had a pint, taste just OK, gathered our booty and went home.

It was when I got home and really poured into the two beers we had filled our growlers with; an IPA and the Duck Piss Red or some such name which was supposed to be an amber.  To qualify, prior to leaving the house, I washed both growlers with dish soap and rinsed and then a drop of iodine and rinsed thoroughly.  They were both sterile and clean.  Both beers were entirely overwhelmed by Diacetyl.  It's a bacterial byproduct of fermentation and skilled brewers can control it, and actually use it to enhance their beers flavor given certain malt combos, but we're talking about Dan Kahn here.  The buttery, creamy, carmel sickness... even on the IPA was just disgusting.  Waste of $10.  Both growlers were down the drain as that's the only place for Buckbean's schwill.

A couple of prints are in the Patrick Nagel style. Also a Postmaster appointment certificate sign by President Dwight D Eisenhower- from a simpler time when such things had great meaning.

This is definitely not your typical cafeteria, though (is anything that UO ever does ever typical? no).  There are six stations (grill, sandwhich, salad, pizza, etc. etc.) that have some fixed items that are there every day that are delish (my default: turkey gouda sandwhich - is grilled and has sundried tomato pesto on it. YUM!), and then they have specials that change every day.  The menu is inventive and creative.  I have definitely enjoyed trying the things that they've got.  And everything is made to order!

It's a tad pricey (~$8 for a sandwhich), but not too terrible.  And you may have to wait a short while if you hit the lunch rush.

People make a big deal about this place, and I think that's just because it's the trendiest and most convenient of the Navy Yard's few options: Mercer Café and Lo Spiedo are both way too expensive, and neither is quick enough if you actually need to get back to work within a reasonable timeframe, while Di Nic's is an okay alternative, but to be honest, you're better off just driving to WaWa if you want a sandwich.  543 is still too expensive, no matter what you get, but you can at least get in, pick something reasonably tasty, and get on with your life in a reasonable timeframe.  

The saving grace of Shop 543 used to be its pizza--you could get two bigass New York-style slices of whatever was on offer (there was usually plain, pepperoni, and one or two ""special"" slices) and a can of soda for $5 ($5.40 with tax).  Unfortunately, Vetri recently took over the pizza station, and serves ~5"" square slices of pan pizza...now, you can get two slices and a can of soda for $6 (6.48)--as the cashier helpfully told me today, ""it's pretty much still the same deal.""  What was so obvious as to not bear mentioning was that this is in fact more money for worse pizza, and less of it.  

543's other choices are wide-ranging, including: generic burgers at its grill station, soup/salad, Asian noodle dishes, and premade reheated sandwiches.  All of it is overpriced, and roughly the quality of your average lunch buffet.

On the plus side, at any given time, Shop 543 is filled with URBN employees, with the occasional middle-aged Navy employee there just to stare at the sexy young women.  So yeah, the scenery is pretty nice.  If you're a single guy (or girl), you might have some luck, though I'd guess they've all heard it all before.  There's also a Wells Fargo ATM, which I used regularly until it became more convenient to just get cash back at the grocery store.  So there's that.",3.341333333333333,3.0,neutral,15

Huge, beautifully repurposed, natural light-filled building with Koi ponds and trees and seductively oversized, cushy-looking armchairs and a gym overlooking the entrance (""Oh. They're having cardio for lunch. I don't want to be like them."").

Giant board at the Shop 543 entrance displaying specials for the different stations: Grill, Salad, Sushi, Pizza, Sandwiches, Wok, etc. The one that caught my eye was Composed Dishes, because what does that even mean? And all it says under it each day is ""Over 20 options."" This is too trendy for me. Whatever, but this Thai Basil Whatever sounds good.

So, yeah, initially overwhelmed, I tried the Asian stir fry at the last station - way down past the salad and pizza stations, the line winding past 8671338764171781 foot windows, looking out over the water at the biggest ship I've ever seen. #love

The stir fry was great, and although it was packed, they accommodated my coworker's extensive list of dietary restrictions and allergies without flinching. Ditto the prego, and my post-surgical ass with all our wants and needs. I bee-lined to the wok on a few subsequent visits because it was delicious, nothing else on the specials board caught my eye, and, most importantly, it was familiar. 

A few weeks ago, however, a special at the very first station called my name - the falafel I'd been craving for weeks. As I stood in the short line, I noticed the buffet of food next to me with the huge, expeditiously moving line, and dared to wander over. This is when I discovered Composed Dishes.

As I stepped up, I said ""Hello, I'm new here and I am overwhelmed."" The nice lady smiled and said ""Welcome. Don't worry, I will help you."" She filled my own personal recycled, definitely biodegradable, probably turns into a tree container with scoops and tongsful of $8.43/lb deliciousness. She answered every question I had about everything I saw. The first time I had coconut curry chicken and roasted brussels and grilled string beans and cucumbers and caprese salad and some kind of Greek quinoa (or couscous) salad with peppers and feta and it was all MARVELOUS. 

You get your food and grab a drink from the cooler, or try one of their homemade teas and lemonades, or just grab a free cup of water, then there's the dessert station in the front next to the registers and you grab a table and it's all just SO good. There are salted chocolate chip cookies (black salt!) and vegan brownies every day and a mix of other changing varieties. One day I had a cheesecake bar and had to go back and buy a second to take back to work for later.

On my most recent visit (yesterday), I had chicken salad and potato salad and wheatberry salad and curried cauliflower and roasted broccoli and tuna and asparagus and caprese salad and roasted brussels and mac and cheese and a chicken feta sausage link. It was all perfect. I got a brown sugar cookie and it was obviously made of love and magic.

My only complaint is that when I pay by the pound, I would like better control over how much I get of each food. Yesterday's feast weighed almost two pounds, despite my repeated pleas for ""just a tiny bit,"" and ""just one cucumber, please."" I mean, it's fine, because I am sitting here now, still enjoying the delicious everything, and I will have plenty left for tomorrow, but I'm just saying, good thing I had an emergency $20 stashed in my phone case.

My love of delicious food is real, and I will deal with bad service to get it, but everyone here is SO nice. From the cooks to the servers, to the cashiers and the bus boy. And it's just so COMFORTABLE. There are people playing cards and large groups laughing and people giggling in the lounge chairs and people playing with their dogs out front and some very cool entrepreneurs showing their wares waiting for the URBN buyers... Not to mention, you get to eat lunch in the shadow of the USS JFK which has an amazing history and legacy. #love",3.341333333333333,4.1899999999999995,positive,15

Well that's how I came to eat at Le Baobab Restaurant. I was in SW Philly, and as usual, hungry on the run, I was headed to a breakfast spot that served only breakfast all day. I wanted to try it out because the owner was the ex-Head Chef at the Four Seasons Hotel. But alas the spot wasn't open and looked like it was out of business, but I will keep trying till I find the real story. 
Le Baobab was right next door and I went inside to ask if they knew anything about the other spot and a pretty African lady said 'no, I don't know anything about them, are you hungry?"" My answer was ' Does the Parking Authority suck?"" She smiled and said ""have a seat"". I was the only customer and I thought what the heck.... 
It was a small place with nice African Art and a few tables & chairs. I chose Chicken Brochette with Jolof of Rice and a veggie called Potato Leaf along with Plantains. 
I love African food and while a lot of foods in West African are similar, each country has it's own spin on the same dishes. Le Baobab' cuisine is from Burkina Faso and the food had some unfamiliar spices,but was hearty and filling while helping my imagination go to a place I've never been before.",3.7722222222222226,2.23,neutral,18

It's a simple little restaurant that usually does 3 dishes: Grilled chicken, lamb, or whole fish. They say that they will cook other foods if it's a large enough order, so I've never had the chance to taste anything else.

My favourite is the grilled chicken. It's a large platter of pieces of chicken legs and thighs, charred but still juicy and succulent.  Very flavourful and perfectly cooked.  It comes topped with a chopped onion-oil sauce & your choice of side. 5 stars

I've tried the fried plantains as well as the attieke & both were good. 

Fish is good (4 stars) & the lamb is also not bad (3.5 stars), but the grilled chicken is our favourite (5 stars).

Be warned that the dollop of spicy sauce on the side of the plate is quite hot.

In Le Baobab's kitchen, they cook the food to order & this shows in both the quality (tasty!) and speed (so slooooooow).  It usually takes at least 30-45 minutes after ordering to get the food. It's best to call ahead & order by phone about half an hour in advance, to cut your wait time.

The biggest issue here is that they are not very good at communicating accurately how long the food will take. Once, we called in & were told the food would take 40 minutes; in reality, we waited 1.5 hours before the food was ready. Granted, they were very busy that night with a huge order, but if they had given an accurate estimate, we could've decided whether to wait or go somewhere else. The slowness is not ideal but they're so friendly & they cook such good food that it's not a huge problem.

Summary: Great food. Service is friendly but slow.",3.7722222222222226,4.51,positive,18

Although there are so many west African restaurants in the area, I was still very skeptical. Some restaurants skimp on the meat in dishes, but many seem to decline in food quality down the line. In other words, it seems that restaurants may be taking shortcuts that result in faster preparation times, but also salty, dried out food. Coming to Le Baobab felt like taking a chance.

The store is small with very plain decor, but the customer service from both the man and the woman was great. I asked questions about the portion size and dishes and got a response that was stellar. For example, the man went to the kitchen and returned with a made-up platter for reference, instead of relying on vague descriptions. The amount of chicken in that styrofoam platter was perfect (it was a lot!) I eagerly place my order of the grilled chicken, attieke, and fried plantains. Before I paid, the woman opened each container to show me the meal. This was a great touch because I knew exactly what I was ordering before I paid. 

The food, oh gosh, it was delicious! Like I said, the portions are large. Each side had it's on styrofoam container the size of a fried rice platter (i.e. fried rice & chicken wings) from any of the neighborhood Chinese spots nearby. The attieke was cooked perfectly and was light. The plantains were cut up, perfectly ripe and fried to a nice golden brown. They were also sweet and soft. The chicken was pure perfection, featuring cuts and pieces of thighs and drumsticks. Nicely grilled with charred crispness on the very outer edges, but the skin and meat were still very succulent. It was also very well seasoned, with very little reliance on the usual abundance of salt. A nice touch was the diced onion, tomato, pepper mix that was blended in some sort of light sauce on top of the chicken. It was slightly similar to the taste and consistency of the diced veggies in pasta salad tossed in Italian dressing. Some additional condiments were a chicken flavored bullion cube in the attieke (I didn't need it) and a small cup of a red pepper sauce. The sauce starts out a tad sweet, but gets very spicy at the end. I wasn't a fan of it because of the initial sweetness, but the ending spiciness was great. However, I didn't eat it with my food. I used another brand of pepper sauce I had in the fridge, which complimented my meal perfectly.

I plan on coming back to try other dishes. Actually, I initially had my eyes set on the grilled lamb, but they were all out, so I settled on the chicken. This gives me an excuse to go back for the lamb very soon!

Over our last visits, food quality hasn't been consistent. Sometimes the chicken is succulent and perfectly grilled, while at other times it's overcooked and dry. When it's dry, I need more sauce with it; once we were charged $1 for a tiny container of hot pepper sauce & $2 for more onion sauce. Grilled fish is usually good and tasty. The plantains are pretty much always good: a great starchy accompaniment when not so ripe & deliciously soft and sweet when ripe. 

On certain days of the week, the kitchen cooks up some stew. I've tried the stew once & it was warm and comforting.

Service is variable. Sometimes it's friendly & sometimes not so much, depending on who's there. There have been a few issues.  One night, at the end of a long 13-hour drive back to Philadelphia, I called in an order to Le Baobab around 10:15 pm. I was told they were closing at 11:00 pm so I'd need to arrive by closing time to pick up my order. I agreed. We rushed to the restaurant. When I got there at 11, my order was nowhere to be found. We ended up waiting 45 minutes longer (after we arrived at the restaurant) for the food to be ready. It appeared they had forgotten about our order & then started cooking it after we arrived. The long delay was inconvenient since we were very hungry after the long drive. We could've gone somewhere else if we'd known that they didn't have our food, but they didn't tell us that that's what had happened. There was no apology, no acknowledgement, no communication.

Located in the beautifully remodeled Trevose Shopping Center, along with a brand new Fitness Center! Eat a donut and go work out afterwards. No problem.

Would you believe that I have 73 Dunkin Donuts within 10 miles of my home? Eight of them are within 3 miles. 

It is amazing to me how this company continues to grow in this economy, while other businesses are closing down, right and left. I think that we keep it alive, as consumers, for that ultimate love of a fresh donut or is it the busy life styles and breakfast & coffee on the run. It surely is a combination of both. 

Dunkin Donuts has come a long way, in order to compete with the Star Bucks and McDonald's of our world. 

They sell an endless array of Coffees and Teas, hot or iced to go along with those donuts. They have a line of Hot Chocolates now and the White Hot Chocolate is divine. If you have not tried the Peach Iced Tea, then you are missing out. 

They serve Breakfast ""Omelet"" Sandwiches, with Sausage or Bacon along with a side of Hash Brown bites. Their Muffins have a touch of Crumb & Icing goodness on top! I love the new Pumpkin Muffin and the Pumpkin donut isn't too shabby either! 

For Lunch grab an individual Pizza or a Flatbread Sandwich and I'm telling you now, the Ham & Swiss Cheese Flatbread Sandwich is pretty darn good!

For today's busy lifestyles and grub on the go Dunkin Donuts full fills those early morning blues or mid afternoon hunger pains.  Wake up America, it's Dunkin Donut time ;+}",1.2435714285714285,2.42,neutral,14

I've ordered from here around a dozen times and up until the last few months everything had been pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a Domino's chain. Over the last six months we've had five successive orders go wrong. 

First mishap was a missing salad. Mistakes happen, I ignored it. 
Second order, another missing salad. Called in and was told they'd credit a salad on the next order.  
Third order, paid for another salad that didn't come AND the pizza dough was raw. 
Fourth order, ordered pasta and was sent a bread bowl instead. 
Fifth and final order, ordered pasta got another bread bowl.

The ""credit"" doesn't cover online orders, so in order to use the credit you have to skip the reward points from online orders.  The only way to get a refund is to drive out to the store.

The bright side is how amusingly consistent the mistakes were. Order a salad, nothing comes. Switch to pasta and you'll get a bread bowl. Not sure what happened as we never had issues before. If you want Domino's from here, pick it up and look it over.",1.915294117647059,1.0,negative,17

Same Coffee, but with dinner food and alcohol added in.  an all around good idea and unfortunately not too many independent coffee houses get around to doing it. Fortunately that's exactly what Intermezzo is doing and they're doing a pretty damn good job of it!

due to happenstance and a sudden change of plans I ended up going to my friends New Years Eve party concert that took place here last night. because it was New Years Eve there are a few things I'm not sure of and didn't get a chance to try (hence the 4 stars as opposed to 5). They obviously weren't set up to sell a whole lot of coffee considering what holiday it was, So the coffee side was more or less closed down, and the food menu was cut off aside from certain sandwiches. But they did have a mini buffet and the food was UNREAL. I ate the best ravioli's that I ever had, tasty sandwiches, and chips with fresh black bean salsa. based on what I had  I would easily recommend coming here for a meal. The Coffee is fair trade too.

On to the bar - I can't tell whether it was because they had holiday specials, or if it was usual prices, but the Alcohol was dive bar cheap. we're talking $2 Yuenglings and $3 Red Bull and Vodka cheap. I'm also pretty sure that I saw City Wide Specials flowing too. if this is the case on a regular basis than this would easily be my regular bar if they didn't close at midnight. then again it probably would be for a lot of people which is probably exactly why they do close then.

as far as live music goes the sound quality was pretty damn good for a coffee house. it was about equal to Tritone's which isn't always the best for a legit music venue, but it's enough for a place like here.  The only flaw concert wise was that it was pretty hard to navigate around the band due to where they were set up. you literally had to avoid bumping into a cello player to use the bathroom. but for a free show it was a reasonable thing to work around.

I overheard the owner (Mark) talk about how he's interested in bringing in more live music. So if you're a musician take note, and if you're a fan keep an eye out for this spot. I know I am.",3.2693333333333334,2.83,neutral,15

Since I was originally here for a New Year's Gathering I didn't get to sample it on a normal day. But it was so good that I had to give it it's due anyway. I was intending to try it sooner, but by now you can pull up a long list of reviews that reveal me as a slacker so you probably get the trend. No matter though because what counts was the fact that I had the biggest egg and cheese with bacon that I've ever had. And it came of two fresh pieces of wheat toast instead of an english muffin.

- Cafe + bar ambiance is really nice-- tiny, dark and cool, a perfect escape from a muggy night (thanks, Philadelphia).  
- As others have mentioned, the seating isn't exactly... cushioned.  But this isn't a place that should be characterized by ragged couches or dirty hippies anyway.  (Clean hippies, yes.)
- Iced coffee was surprisingly good and served in a beer tumbler, which tickled me.  
- Open late!!  Since leaving New York, I've learned to appreciate the rarity of cafes that actually deign to stay open past 8pm.
- The guy (definitely the owner) was helpful and friendly and did it all without smiling much.  Points to anyone who can pull off this level of coooooool.  
- Intermezzo sells beer!  By the bottle!  To go!  An exciting thing, as I had not yet figured out/accepted ""state stores"" in Pennsylvania.  A Dogfish 4-pack was vaguely cheaper ($14) than at a Whole Foods (outside PA, obviously).  I wasn't committed to buying all 4 so the guy just split the price by 4 for each bottle.  (Then I bought all 4 anyway.)
- Live music on Friday nights, open mics on Wednesday nights. Get your to-go beer before 9:30pm when the display cases are blockaded by the band.  
- Slight thumbs down: It was just before 10pm on a Friday night and the teeny place was mostly empty.  If not for the musicians literally bringing along a cohort of their friends, the live act might have been pretty awkward.",3.2693333333333334,4.46,positive,15

I also got some hot wings and there guys do wings right that were finger lickin good wings

This place has a fairly expansive menu of awesome freshly-made grilled sandwiches. Everything is cooked on a flat top griddle and the food takes 15-20 minutes to prepare depending on how busy they are, and they suggest that you call ahead because of that.

Their signature lemonade is supposed to be frozen, but during busy lunch hours it will usually be served chilled, but I'm not complaining. They have several fruity lemonade flavors, and each of them are excellent. They even put a fresh orange slice on your lemonade which is a cool touch.

The gyro, chicken Philly, ragin Cajun, and chicken parmesean sandwiches are all excellent. Their fries are delicious too, covered with some sort of seasoned salt. I've never tried the fish but it seems like every time I'm in there someone is ordering it so it must be decent.

I visited Famous Steak & Lemonade on the recommendation of a family member. While I'm not s huge fan of fried food, sometimes the mood just strikes me. Famous is decidedly ok. The staff are quite friendly, and the space itself is clean and well maintained. I was surprised by the various goods for sale in the storefront restaurant. I've never been inside a bodega, but I imagine that Famous shares some of the same features and items available for sale. 

The food is well cooked, but slightly under-seasoned. That was disappointing, as I asked for additional seasoning on my order. The food is fresh, and orders are prepared quickly, which is a plus. Famous wouldn't be my first choice for this type of cuisine, but it will certainly do in a pinch.",3.3230769230769233,1.8200000000000003,negative,13

This past weekend, my mom told my sister and I about it and how her and her friends ate here all the time, since we've been on the search for the best ""hood rice""/""china men"" in town, so we figured we'd check it out. The chicken (I ordered the hot-braised plate) was the best chicken I've had. They're big chunks, hand breaded and sauced to perfection. And when I say big chunks, they are BIG CHUNKS but they're not fatty or gross big chunks. It's real chicken. The rice is actual, real fried rice. You can order plain, or they offer many different options from veg.fried rice to seafood fried rice (I ordered ham fried rice). The crab Rangoon is the salty kind (which is the best kind) and the portions are big. Prices are great for what you get. They only accept cash, so be aware of that before stopping in. However, there is an ATM Machine at the liquor store a few doors down that we went to to get some money out. Where they are located isn't in the best town, and the appearance of the outside isn't the best, but that doesn't matter; I promise you, this is the best Chinese food you will get in this area. The staff are also so very friendly and kind and always had a smile on their face when taking our order. We even went back for more fried rice a few hours later, the same day!!

I ordered mine light on the sauce. Crab rangoon small order is 3. It was mediocre. I'll just try egg rolls or potstickers next time.

To try more food I also ordered pork fried rice. Look at those large pieces of pork! It was perfectly seasoned.

*Negatives
- It's literally 100 degrees out today and it was sooo HOT inside the dining room 
- The chicken was really dry
- Rough chop on some things = huge chunks of some things; small of others. Is it a huge deal? No. Does it make for a less pleasant experience? Yes. 
- Uneven distribution of spinach vs all else on my wrap (see pic)
- The wrap got kind of gummy and began to tear really quickly (though it tasted good)
- The lemon cilantro dressing needs adjusting. Good concept, but something is sort of off balance in taste.
- Pricey, fairly limited menu
- Terrible physical layout 
- House made drinks were in rectangular plastic bins with spouts (warm) on the counter - should they be kept cold to reduce the risk of bacteria growth? Especially on a day when it's so hot in/outside? 
- Owner (manager?) Becky and two other staff members sat at the two tables closest to the counter with laptops. Working, I assume. 

It didn't seem like a meeting, per se, but it made the dining room feel micro-managed...and like it was their office. 

*Positives
- Danielle, at the counter: five star employee! Patient, knowledgeable, friendly. 
- The taste of the food was pretty good, barring some mushy (in spots) cucumber on my wrap
- The bacon was excellent, both in taste and in preparation
- The apple slices were a sweet, fresh, nice, unexpected touch, though served on a huge helping of (wasted) spinach in a bowl, under the wrap
- Cute, inspirational sayings decorate the benches

Firstly it's all locally sourced and non gmo, etc and you can chose to modify your bowl based on different diet restrictions. Yes some people really do have gluten sensitivities, it is not made up, it's very painful. Anyway this is a great healthy place to eat. Rather expensive but that was expected. You have a variety of sauces and veggies to throw in your bowl. I picked mine out and so did my parents who happen to be new to the vegetarian life so they were happy to find a place they could easily make a meal without meat. 

We receive our food and mine and my mother's were missing the brown rice we asked for. Not a big deal they gave us both a side and we dumped it in. As I'm eating my dad and I both notice that our bowls are exceptionally gritty. It's full of sand. They simply did not wash the vegetables before adding it to the bowls.  Huge oversight to me. And very difficult to be forgiven. Maybe it's because I'm pregos and I'm a little more sensitive to food that potentially wasn't cleaned well, but when you're paying $12 plus for food please clean the veggies. Still makes you questions other practices that might be neglected. Sadly I ended up throwing out about 3/4 of it. I couldn't eat it. 

Sigh.... I'm going to more than likely try them again I appreciate their locally sourced foods and they have a yummy selection of teas. Hopefully I can update to a better review.",3.8186666666666667,1.37,negative,15

I love that they compost and recycling and if you dine and have reusable options. I would call it a fast casual style restaurant the food comes quickly and it's much healthier than fast food.

I had some issue with Food for Your Soul.

These were issues I encountered:

My first issue:  when I called to place my order I was placed on hold for almost nine minutes.

My second issue: if I didn't asked do they accept cash or card, I would have been more annoyed to found out after I arrived to pick up my food that I needed cash.

My third issue: they were very slow and when I called I wasn't informed that they were backed up or there was a huge wait time. I order my food at 6:33pm and I received it at almost 7:20pm.

My fourth issue: they were out of one of the side orders but they never called to inform me of that. I found out the side I wanted was out of stock upon picking my food.

My fifth issue: my platter container was severely damage and if I had pulled the platter out of the bag most of the food would have been on my floor. 

Also pieces of the damage platter was found throughout the Mac and cheese. See pictures.

My sixth and final issue: my sister's chicken breast was dried and over fried.

I came to the place because I am fan and avid watcher of JL Jupiter's YouTube channel. Shout out to JL Jupiter.

But this place needs to work on their efficiency and customer service in regards to letting their customer base know there is problem prior to an order being taken and money given.

I won't be back.

I wish the owner a lot of success in her endeavors but if she really wants to be more of successful, she needs to tweak the things I mentioned because these minor issues can cause you to lose some of your customer base.

It was almost 8 in the evening so I already knew the Mac and cheese was sold out, lol. A friendly young lady greeted me as I approached the window to place my order. ""Hi, any more Mac and cheese?"", I asked knowing full well I had missed the window of opportunity, but I needed to confirm anyway just in case. Of course I was right but she then rattled off a list of all the other sides they had: cabbage, candied yams, collard greens, potato salad, etc. I decided on a turkey wing platter with cabbage and candied yams. They have a really nice outdoor eating area so I waited there until my name was called. Made it about 3/4 of the way home and I had to dig in. There's amazing white rice underneath the 2 large turkey wings and they were smothered in a nice gravy. Yams were spot on as well as the cabbage (not overly cooked). Only thing missing that I was hoping to see was a slice of cornbread. Glad I stopped in. Will be back!",3.8771428571428572,4.15,positive,14

If you have 2 hours to waste feel free to come here. I called beforehand to place my order and they said 20 minutes. I show up in person 40 minutes later because I read reviews that they take a long time. They take my money and then put my order in.  That should be told to people who order over the phone since there's clearly no point in ordering beforehand. Then they told me it would be 15 minutes. Two people who came in person after me got their food before me. 40 minutes passed and I ask if my food is coming and they say they're waiting on my food now. So I initially called in my order at 3:50 pm and by 5:30 pm they still didn't have my food. By that point I asked for my money back since they would've had me waiting all night I'm sure. If the food isn't going to be ready don't lie to your customers and waste their time.

My fiance and I decided to check it out, as we are always in search of new and wonderful places to eat!  We were not disappointed with the Seafood Shack of Tennessee!

Location - This is not located in the midst of the major shopping or out in the popular Indian Lake area.  You have to go looking for it but trust me, it is worth looking for.  Try it!

Atmosphere - The restaurant is large and clean.  There is not a lot of decorations or frills on the walls (which I rather like!).  There are no TVs blasting sports (again, I love this!) and there was a nice soft classical jazz mix playing over the speakers.

Food - I ordered the blackened fish with grit cakes.  First time I had ever had grit cakes and wow!  They are so delicious! The fish was perfectly cooked and the spice was perfect!  Not too hot and plenty of flavor.  My fiance ordered the broiled fish platter.  It came with several types of broiled fish, tasty and lightly seasoned.  We also ordered a crawfish mac and cheese to split, on our waiters recommendation.  It was very good! Cheesy, plenty of crawfish and large penne noodles.  We both had a drink on tap (me a Crispin cider, fiance a local from Yazoo, Dos Perro).   Both of our meals came with the salad bar as well (as do all entrees).  The salad bar has a nice selection it, including fresh fruit, some mixed salads and the soup of the day.  This day, the soup was a seafood gumbo.  We were sooo tempted by the desert buffet but too full to try it.  We will definitely be back just to try the coffee and desert some night!

Waiter - our waiter was Max.  He was helpful and informative and gave us information about this new business, owner and chef.   It is always nice to hear about the details behind the place you're eating at!

We tried it on a Tuesday night which is their All You Can Eat Catfish and Salad Bar for $13.99. 

The salad bar was a bit of a hike from our table but we tried it anyway. The mushrooms were old and eating them would have caused someone to be ill. The rest of the items on the salad bar appeared/tasted fresh. The mayonnaise-based dressings appeared good but I opted for the vinaigrette which was a bad choice. I would have much preferred Italian but the only other vinegar-based option was vinegar and oil.

The server forgot the only beverage that our table ordered and we had to ask for it twice. 

I ordered a small broiled seafood platter ($15) and the fish was warm but overcooked and rubbery. The 2 shrimp were overcooked and the 2 scallops were tiny. The rice under the broiled fish was average. The black beans and crab cake were delicious. The 2 crab legs were small, overcooked, and had water running from them.

The server brought the others in my party their catfish to go with the all-you-can-eat special. The plate was 2 pieces of catfish, 2 hushpuppies, and fries. The catfish seemed to be cooked in flour (and not cornmeal) and the inside was undercooked. The hush puppies had large chunks of onion in them and were undercooked.

I am very disappointed because I was looking forward to this new seafood option in this area. I am not sure if the cook had an off night or this is standard. I am also wondering if just giving this new restaurant time to sort out any issues will correct the problems. We may give it awhile and try again.",2.85625,1.0,negative,16

For dinner, I had the blackened fish and grits, with creole sauce.  Nashville isn't New Orleans, but this was very good nonetheless.  The grits were fried into grit cakes, and they really complemented the creole seasoning on the fish.  My wife had the scallops, and they were delicious.  My daughter got their shrimp po-boy sandwich, and it was huge.  She enjoyed it immensely, for two days in-a-row.

We ordered the grilled cheese kids dinner for our daughter and the crab dip appetizer for us. Her food came out relatively fast and was fine. Our dip came out and just sight alone looked disgusting. I wish I had taken pictures. It had a layer of grease that sat on top of the burnt cheese layer. We decided to forge ahead and at least try it and was greeted with a slimy, fishy mush. We immediately sent it back and just decided not to get another appetizer.

I ordered the fried shrimp and fish platter. The shrimp were over-cooked inside the batter and were chewy. The fish was so over battered that I peeled away layers to reveal a very over-cooked and tiny tasteless fish fillet which I couldn't even eat. My husband ordered the broiled seafood platter which had crab cakes, shrimp, fish, and scallops. The crab cakes were fishy and mushy like the dip. The rest of the entree was covered so much in the seasoning that you couldn't even taste anything else....which in hindsight was probably on purpose.

All in all, an extremely disappointing meal and we would NEVER go back. I don't see this place staying open long.",2.85625,1.0,negative,16

First off, LOOK AT THESE PICTURES!!!  LOOK AT THEM!!!

So it's a restaurant and bakery.  Which I assume means they make a significant amount of bread products from scratch, which is a plus in my book.

All of the negative reviews and complaints about this place seem to revolve around its delivery.  I'm philosophically opposed to delivery since it deprives one of the dining experience and promotes laziness against home-cooking. Coupled with the bad reviews, suffice to say, don't get delivery from here (or anywhere for that matter).

Ultimately though, if you haven't had Georgian food before, it amounts to a mix between Eastern European,  Middle Eastern, Chinese, and cheesy bread.  Sound like it's hard to imagine?

Literally walking around just serving food with earbuds in the ear the entire time no less or just sitting at a table not once checking on anyone to see if they need anything. The waitress literally made a face every time we asked for something. I really believe as others have mentioned that if you're not Georgian they don't want you there. Never felt so unwelcome in my life at any establishment. We literally sat for an hour before anyone came over to take our order and when we asked for water and a bottle opener, after no joke an HOUR of just sitting there, the waitress said ""and what about food"" with the nastiest face and attitude we've ever seen. My friend even commented on how ""happy"" she looked. We had to ask for water 4 times before she brought it! We got food before she brought water and then brought 1 bottle of water instead of a pitcher. We had to ask again for a pitcher. Thank goodness we placed our entire order at once because if we hadn't we wouldn't have been able to order anything else as we never saw the waitress again after we received our food. I've never left a place feeling like I wouldn't tip but this was definitely that one and only time I've ever felt that way and unfortunately they applied a 15% service fee for 4 people. Never been charged a ""service"" fee for 4 people anywhere. I don't know maybe that's why the service is so bad because they automatically charge a 15% service fee. ‍ Needless to say I will never be back.

The restaurant opened less than a week ago so needless to say, it's clean! The service is fast and friendly. The menu has more than Burritos. It offers Enchiladas, Fajitas, Quesadillas, Salad and Soup, Tacos and so on. 

After being seated, out came chips and salsa (verde). Instead of ordering the appetizer size Guacamole for $8, you can order a side for $3.50. The Guacamole was simple but fresh. The chips were perfectly salted.

I'm a big Enchiladas fan. I tried the Shredded Chicken with Salsa Verde. An order will get you three Enchiladas plus Rice and Beans. Not bad for $11. The same order across the river will cost you another $3.

The portions are on the larger size. The prices are very reasonable. I left full and can't wait to go back. I only wish they had a liquor license and could sell Margaritas!

UPDATE: I've been back to try more from the menu. I was not disappointed in any of my choices. The Sopa de Tortilla was so fresh. And it was only $4. I might have to order it EVERY time I go. The Salt Cured Steak Tacos were good. The Steak was seasoned well. Each taco was topped with onions and cilantro. You didn't need more than a squeeze of lime. They also came with Salsa Verde and a HOT Red Sauce. The Red Sauce had some heat. As in, I ended up with hiccups. You get four tacos in an order for less than $10. The Shredded Chicken Flautas are another good entree. I'm used to having them as an appetizer.

After waiting 35 minutes for the Guacamole Fiesta appetizer, I asked a server the status of this order.  After an additional 15 minutes passed, our entrees were delivered, still with no appetizer.  Upon inquiry, it was communicated that the guacamole had run out.  My husband and I waited an hour for tacos and tostadas with no refill of chips or follow-up from the server.  After nicely asking to speak with the manager, I was told he was in an incredibly bad mood, had yelled at our server, and would not speak to me.  

The staff was incredibly overwhelmed, were unable to handle the large crowd, and did not have the experience and know-how to let customers know when food items are no longer available.

Then one day my sister whispered to me 'try the grilled, you'll love it!'. She was right. She knows me so well. The grilled chicken is highly seasoned, sort of crispy on the outside, and super juicy inside. Their green beans incite me to sing little songs and do little dances. But what I like best of all is that I'm pretty sure the young man working the drive through also inhabits the cover of MAD magazine. He always looks like he's up to some sort of mischief, and I kind of wish he was. 

So I'm on the Kentucky Grilled Chicken bandwagon. My sister was right, she knows what's up.

I really wanted some chicken. I went to this location on a slow, rainy Sunday afternoon. There were maybe 3-5 people total in store. There were people in drive thru. Not very busy at all. Floor was slick from rain and slippery. Gentleman behind counter may have been new. He radioed over headset to ask if he could take my $20 bill. I asked the difference between the #2 (breast 2pc combo), & the #10 (all dark meat combo). Neither of which on ""$5 Fill Up"" menu. I ordered the #2 sub mash for fries add sm. mac/cheese. I noticed on receipt as I sat waiting for my order that I was rang up wrong with a $5 menu add Mac. I went to talk about it and he ""fixed"" my problem by just giving me the chicken I ordered no change on receipt. The chicken skin was visibly old and see through from grease like cellophane. The box had mashed and gravy. So, I said I wanted a refund. That made twice the order was wrong and the food looked disgusting. I didn't want to eat there. He tried to offer fresh but the wait was too long. Manager that did refund was running drive thru. Acted as if did not want to refund. Gave me incorrect change. Brought it to her attention. She got rude and refused to look at the receipt or hear my complaint. I laid all change on counter and explained I walked in with a twenty, told her the problems, COUNTED MY CHANGE, and told her she still owed me money. I told her I walked in with a $20 and I was not walking out with $18.94. She asked what she still owed me. I said what is 20 minus 18.94?!? Look at the receipt like I asked you to and you would KNOW! She offered to call police. Mind you this location has recently been in news for someone shooting someone else in self defense... meanwhile, the gentleman in line behind me had come in and is hearing this. His complaint; he went through drive thru and didn't get change. I told her she makes extra money skimming people. Someone should shut this place down or seriously look into it.

The yuca was unseasoned; no chimichurri, no mojo criollo. 

The picadillo, my wife reported sadly, had no olives and wasn't tasty enough to finish, and that was a real accomplishment because she had been hungry when we arrived.

I was lucky enough to get there on the night they had fried chicken.  Very tasty and juicy, the breading was really good.  Right up there with Sylvan Park, for sure.
Like most ""meat & three"" places, the people who work there are almost as important as the food.  As for At The Table, the people are super nice.  I even spoke with the owner named Robert Hudson, who told me a bit about his family history in Nashville and the restaurants history.

The food was hot and delicious, and they reviewed my order, opening every container to ensure it looked correct before I left the building. Staff was friendly and helpful. I had the catfish, mac & cheese, collard greens, & cornbread. The mac was thick and cheesy and the greens were super flavorful.

Cold Beer? Check. Working TV's? Check. 

As a sports bar, what more could I ask for? It does it's job but I do have a few complaints.

1) Service. It's a brand new spot so there are obviously some kinks. But, I must say - process aside - that some of the employees are just straight up dumb. Is that mean-sounding​? Probably, but they just lack some of the basic principals of holding a job. Whatever, though.

2) Food. I would really, REALLY question whether or not they tested out the menu prior to actually serving it. It was bad. And for the price in Philly, they better step their game up.

3) Speaking of food and service......out of a few dozen​ orders, they managed to get not one single order correct. Legit. How's this happen?

4) Sloppiness throughout. As I mentioned, the bar is brand. spanking. new. So, I wasn't expecting too much. However, from a details standpoint, they just really dropped the ball. Large holes in walls, outlets with electronics protruding​ from the wall (Ex. Subwoofers), bathrooms unfinished (Or so they seemed), so on and so fourth. Meh, I'm sure it'll get fixed, though.

Overall, it really is a cool spot with a TON of TV's. I will surely be back and will follow up with another review!",2.963125,2.75,neutral,16

You walk down to the basement area and the place is quite large with at least two bars, large comfy seating areas, and dozens of big-screen TVs. You just weren't permitted to sit there!  There wasn't a soul within 100 feet of me walking in, and there were maybe five people in the whole place.  As I understand it, the owners also run a dance club, and apparently this used to be a club (1925 Cocktail Lounge) and has been re-done as a club-oriented sports bar.  They spent a lot on TVs, that's for sure!  Kind of like a smaller Xfinity Live having a long wall with probably 40 TVs of 50"" to 100"" diagonal size.  Much of the place is set up as VIP areas --- roped off from the general public.  The clearly visible but ""private"" areas offer sofas and coffee tables, but I was told they require a minimum spend of $500.00 and 8-person minimum, or a $50 per person minimum for larger groups.  When I was there it was (hopefully) a slow night and one of the bar areas was roped off, all of the TV/sofa areas were roped off, and I didn't even know about the Ice Room and the Escape Room that I read about here on Yelp.  Service was ok, but it did take a long time to get served, and the first draft beer I selected was unavailable.  If they are playing the snobby upscale club scene with rude or uncaring bartenders and waiters/waitresses, that's not for me, but maybe that explains other reviews.  This could work well for corporate events or groups for big games like March Madness or the Superbowl, but I won't be going back for just a beer and bar food.  Maybe this ""club sports bar"" can work in Philly, but for my money there are too many other great places to watch a game with good food and drink, hospitable staff and attentive management.

It just recently opened this past February and was so new that it did not appear in either of the Uber or Lyft apps for when I tried to visit.  I'm not sure what it was before but it was, at some distant point, a bank as evidenced by two massive vault doors inside the area.

This is one hell of a sports lounge.  I've counted a total of 33 flat screens all in all.  They had some in the hall when you first enter.  Around 4 above each of the two bar areas and a crazy wall of flat screens!   

This place redefines the meaning of a sports lounge.  There are just so many areas to lounge it is fantastic.  First and foremost, is the couch areas in front of the TV wall.  These are reserved areas for certain sporting events but otherwise another open spot to sit at any other time.  Behind that is the main bar area with many stools and a bunch of tables around it.  To the right of that bar is a pool area that has padded seating around it.  And TVs too!  Just past the entrance is the second bar area.

I was mesmerized upon my first visit as there were so many TVs.  It all seemed so chic.  

They have a wide variety of beers on tap so if you like craft brews, then you will be just fine.  Prices were average and on par with other bars.   There was also food as well.  I ordered the chicken tenders.  They tasted great but the portion was unfortunately small.  I only ordered this and so I consider the food here to be on the pricey relative to the portion size you get.

The interior is all about sports and it's like walking in the Hard Rock Cafe of sports lounges.  There are dozens of framed photographs of sports icons and events from the early days of the 20th century to modern day.  It adds a real nice feel to the space.  

Last but not least are the individual bathrooms.  It seems like a weird thing to compliment on but sometimes you need some privacy for when you gotta drop #2!  There are 4 of them and they were clean and well equipped.  Truly, a comforting spot to relieve yourself in :-)

I will definitely be visiting in the future.  Give it a go and prepare to be impressed!",2.963125,2.74,neutral,16

They have a titanic themed escape room apparently but I think you're supposed to book it ahead of time. I looked it up briefly online a week ahead of time and a lot of the time slots were already booked up. I didn't really see anyone going in or out of there while we were there. We arrived at about midnight though so the escape rooms might have been done for the night. I wasn't really planning on doing any attractions here anyway I wanted to just chill and check the place out first and maybe go back another time. We were with a group and it was pretty empty so we ended up doing the ice bar. 

We had to wait about 30 minutes before we could go in. It was $25 a person and you get 2 shots inside with that. I put on gloves that were already wet and they give you fur jackets to put on if you need it. I thought it was a pretty good deal because in Vegas we paid a lot more. But it was really small, basically like a walk in freezer. It was cool that they had a liberty bell ice sculpture. Our bartender was very friendly and offered to take our picture inside.

Once they decided to take my order, the pizza was still cold out of the pizza oven, gnats flying all around, gave it back for some more oven & they burned it. The gnats didn't seem to mind though. 
I was so disgusted with the pizza that my wife asked for a box to go & was handed a small brown paper bag. Lmao. Hours later, still a terrible after taste of burnt tandoori masala in my nasal cavity.

This one on SR60 in Valrico is the best, while the one on SR60 near Kings in Brandon is my last choice of the 4.  I'm not going to go into a detailed review of the entire store.  I do suggest you pay attention to their BOGO offereings each week as they are really good deals.
 
The first of my two favorite items are the Home Run Inn frozen pizzas.  They are a bit pricey, but do seem to be on the BOGO list about once a month, and occasionally are offered at $5 promoted by the manufacturer.  For those of you not from Chicago, this is an excellent restaurant there and they produce the most consistent high quality frozen pizzas I have had, easily better than 95% of the local pizza delivery offerings.  One caveat, avoid their thin crust pizzas as the quality is not as good as the original versions.
 
Second recommendation is from their deli.  I am a big fan of Boar's Head meats and cheeses.  Try the Boar's Head Honey Maple Turkey Breast along with the Boar's Head Baby Swiss Cheese (feel free to ask for a sample slice of each).  You can buy at the regular deli counter by the pound, or you can special request this combination at the sandwich to order line.

Let me first say, this review is based on my personal experience related to the COVID vaccine and its administration. NOT the vaccine itself but rather the horrible customer service I received and the administration of such.
I had a very raised and aggravated insect bite on my upper left arm and pointed this out to the female administrating the vaccine and asked that because of the pain and obvious bite I did not want it in the left arm.  She than stated that it HAD to be in the left arm and that she did not make the rules/policy but just followed them.  She than proceeded to give me the vaccination directly into this infected area.  I was handed the vaccine card with no date for the 2nd shot so I went to the counter and inquired and was told very abruptly to count 28 days.  WHAT?  I asked if I should count Sundays since they are not opened on Sundays and got zero response.  By this time I was not feeling well, went straight home and went to bed.  My condition continued to decline until Saturday when I collapsed and had to be taken to hospital via ambulance.  I have since called the CDC and Moderna asking about the administering in left or right arm and was told by both that it makes no difference.  I then called Publix Pharmacy Corporate supervisor and although a very nice man, he proceeded to explain that the paperwork was filled out prior to my visit and in that paperwork it was specified what arm the injection was administered so this very long story adds up to laziness because this employee did not want to re-do the paperwork.  Please bare in mind, this was at 7:00 on a Thursday evening with no others before me or waiting after me. I also have since asked family/friends who also received their vaccine at different Publix's and all of them stated they were given the choice of arm preferences.This free shot in now costing me thousands of dollars of ambulance and hospital bills and weeks of illness.  Beyond disappointed and dismayed.  Needless to say, I will never/ever use this particular pharmacy in the future and will continue to spread the word of my treatment.",3.3888235294117646,1.0,negative,17

Agree with Tanya S. - their hamburgers are awesome and a very good size. Had a Reuben and a tuna melt as well, both were good and not too greasy. The quality of the corned beef is good, but not out-of-this-world great (hence the 4 stars).

At each table, there is a huge container of different types of pickles in the center (see pic). I can't comment on how they taste because I actually hate pickles but I can tell you about the sandwich I tried. :) I decided to just go with the first thing on their menu, the corned beef ""special"", where ""special"" means adding coleslaw and russian dressing (thousand islandish). This can be done to any of the sandwiches you order and I highly recommend it because coleslaw and sauce were delish! My sandwich came out with plenty of corned beef and on marbled bread. It was quite tasty! My friend tried the roast beef wrap and said it was also very good except they put too much horseradish in it.

The new highway construction slowed us down and we said, ""Why not?"" and turned in.

We found a great farmers market in operation since 1982. They're are a local family owned and operated business. They grow some of the produce  sold, such as  lettuce, spinach, kale, tomatoes, summer squash, cucumbers, various melons, sweet corn, green beans, and too many other vegies to mention here. They also locally bringing in, raspberries, cherries, apricots, blueberries, blackberries, peaches, pears, apples, pluots, plums, grapes, huckleberries, & farm fresh eggs. Also have some green plants for sale: herbs, vegies, landscaping.

The day we went we found okra, fresh green beans and some wonderful peaches, smaller but flavorful. Fresh corn and you can shuck it right there and not have to haul the husks home. Cantaloupe was vine-ripe and full of juice and flavor.

Look for the sign on the North side of Chinden (see photos). Right now (8/2014) there is road construction on Chinden, so watch carefully for either of the driveways into the stand. There is going to be a new stop light at 10 Mile and Chinden, so getting into and out of the Farm will be much easier. If, from Meridian, you go past the new highway intersection, you've gone too far. (Note: All photos are from Wagner's Facebook page and their website.)

The parking and access is good to the sales area. Large lot and level. The lot has small gravel (approx. 1/2""-) and is well packed, but people in wheelchairs can practically park at the edge of the sales area building and the inside sales area is concrete and smooth.

First visit in a couple of days ago and we left with fantabulous, farm fresh produce including two kinds of tree ripe peaches, Christmas melon, two kinds of fresh peppers (Basque and ?), tomatoes, onions and corn.  A big bag (we always bring our own cloth shopping bags) and it was full to the brim for a total of ten bucks. Even.  What a great value for such wonderful produce including the best corn and melon and peaches we've had all season.  The friendly people who work there are an added bonus.   We are eager to return for more.  Highly recommend you go.

1) PARKING:  Gravel lot.

2) ACCESSIBILITY:  Loose, big scale gravel here is not doable for folks using wheelchairs.

So, based on the strong (and terribly WRONG) reviews on yelp, I walked 16 blocks to this place.  Bain's does not deliver unless you order at least $25 worth of stuff and even then, it tacks on a hefty delivery fee if your order is less than $75.  When they said ""we do not deliver"", they were not kidding. I thought they meant that they require you to pick up your food.  Little did I know that they also meant that they do not meet even the most basic expectations.

I ordered two simple sandwiches:  (1) Two eggs with bacon on a kaiser roll; (2) Albacore tuna on a bagel with American cheese.  For any place worth its salt, that would be an easy order.  For the three stooges on duty at this place (one of whom was the owner), however, this order was rocket science.  

I arrived at the place after a long walk and they handed me three sandwiches.  I ordered only two.  The woman behind the counter slowly explained to me, as if I was the idiot, that I had ordered two eggs, so of course, that meant one egg on each of two rolls.  Um, what?  After an explanation that took far too long, she finally understood that I wanted two eggs on one roll.  Imagine that!  I did not want to give her a hard time, so I agreed to take both sandwiches.  I just happened to also ask her in passing if she included bacon in the sandwiches and that led us to mistake #2.  No bacon.  She reassured me that she would quickly add the bacon.  She then walked over to a stack consisting of some of the most beat-up-looking, disgusting strips I have ever laid eyes on.  I started to ask her to forget the bacon, but she insisted she had this covered.  She then threw some old, crusty strips in the microwave.  By the time the microwave beeped, the smell of burning bacon had filled the entire spot.  She then opened up the sandwiches, giving me a view of the spongy, McDonald's-type grossness that they were trying to pass off as eggs, and slapped the charred bacon on my sandwiches.  Great.

Before leaving, I asked if the tuna was albacore.  The menu stated albacore and I had requested albacore, but I was quickly learning one cannot take anything for granted with Bain's Deli.  The owner, standing by as Sandwichgate unfolded, reassured me that it was albacore on a bagel.  Awesome, at least they got that right.

Except not.

I just got back from that craphole and I am currently staring at something that is not albacore.  It is on a dried out, hard bagel that is not the type I asked for.  And there is no American cheese.  In fact, I don't know what the hell this sandwich is.  Bain's deli is 0/2 on the world's simplest order and I am shit out of luck.  My lunch hour is ending, so I guess I will just have to go hungry.  If you want to know how I feel, please go ahead and order from this ramshackle mess of a place.  Bon appetit!",2.888,1.67,negative,15

Tip - This farm and oyster stand is very close to the Route 40 exit on Route 55 so it is only a short detour en route back to Philly from  the Jersey Cape.....",3.905625,2.6900000000000004,neutral,16

It was simple, it was balanced and it was fresh. One bite in I knew this sandwich was worth the $16 they sell it for (which isn't something I say often). The oysters weren't greasy and were lightly fried, but they honestly tasted like they got pulled out of the water that morning. The bread was light and tasted house made. The slaw was a perfect condiment.  I put some local hot sauce on it for some kick, which they offer complimentary on ice near the self serve station which has utensils, napkins, ice water etc. This place is in the middle of nowhere but only 15 minutes from my house. I plan on trying everything on the menu after eating that sandwich - it was legit that good. Mainly a seafood spot but it looked like there were some other alternatives as well. This place made be a believer. My new go to for local, fresh, seafood. Nice little shop inside near the register that sells various local products.

The setup here is, as they explained to me, ""just like subway"". First, you choose your pasta and sauce (check out my photos for the options) for $8.95. Then, you get to fill up a bowl with veggies of your choice, for $3.50. I picked spinach, mushrooms, fresh tomatoes, sun dried tomatoes (I didn't see them until after I added the fresh tomatoes), and roasted corn! Then you can add cheese for varying costs. My 2oz of mozza was $1. Proteins can be added as well ranging in price from $1.25 (or was it $1.50) for prawn, to a few dollars for chicken. There were other meat options as well such as meatballs. If you are staying, you can get your pasta baked with mozzarella, but unfortunately it's not available on to-go orders.

My hearty bowl of pasta was $14, and well worth it. Way more than one person can eat, so you'll definitely have leftovers. And I didn't add any protein! The pesto alfredo is sooooo good and I love that my pasta is full of veggies! Highly recommend!",3.335,3.17,neutral,14

Hours are pretty decent but I'm surprised that they're closed Monday and Tuesday. We came on a Saturday for an eary lunch. 

Basically, you have two options: a signature pasta creation ($13.95 to $18.90) or you can create your own pasta bowl (CYOP). We decided to go with the latter.

8 types of pasta and 8 Amore sauces and 5 premium sauces ($0.95 extra). The more you add, the more expensive your pasta gets. $8.95 for the base, veggies ($3.50 for 180 grams), cheese ($1.00-2.00) and then meats ($2.00-3.00). You can also get your pasta baked ($2.50).

- Fettuccine ($18.70) - go big or go home right? We shared a bowl and opted for the fettuccine with Papa Joe's tomato sauce (gotta go classic first time around), a full bowl of vegetables, mozzarella and sausage. We also got our pasta baked; $2.50 seems steep.

The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente. Cheese was oozy, melty goodness. We added a couple hot peppers which gave the dish a nice simmer of heat. Sauce was simple but bursting with flavour.

This is until I was met with more horror than a film in the Friday the 13th franchise: The greedy early morning scoundrels had eaten every morsel. No bacon, egg and cheese love left for me! Walking away with the feeling of betrayal from my local baristas and my sad pack of Belvita breakfast biscuits, I thought to myself that I wanted a biscuit more savory and buttery than these ""4 hours of nutritious steady energy"" in a wrapper. I wanted a biscuit that was full of love.

Behold, I trotted over to the Pythian and took a peek at their Instagram. Someone had to be serving breakfast there. Of course: Fete au Fete.

I've had Fete au Fete's food in various different spaces. I first indulged in their flavor-packed Cajun and Creole cuisine inside of the St. Roch Market. When I first took a bite of their chicken and waffles, I knew for sure it wouldn't be the last time I'd eat their food. The chicken was well-seasoned and fresh, the waffle crisp and the syrup was different from any I'd ever had.

As I took a peek at the menu, I saw something that caught my eye: a simple sausage, egg and cheese biscuit. I won't lie, the price seemed high for a simple, small breffus sammich that I simply needed to get me to lunch, but when I returned to the office and opened my brown paper bag munchable, I realized I had made the right decision.

The cathead biscuit was fluffy, buttery and reminded me of something my grandma makes from scratch. The sausage was hearty and flavorful and the egg was the perfect fluffy scramble. Not to mention, the sandwich was friggin' HUGE. Definitely a two-handed meal and the most perfect yet simple breakfast I've had in a while.

And just like that, my faith was restored in the land of Breakfast Sandwiches.",3.1423076923076922,3.4000000000000004,neutral,13

Unfortunately the whole experience was disappointment and a huge let down.

My husband and I came here on a Saturday mid-morning recently. Excited for the prospect of not only a new cafe in our neighbourhood, but one that is kid-friendly.

The space is bright, airy and nice. There were 3 other tables occupied when we arrived.

You order at the front and food is brought out to the tables.

There was one person taking orders, another two behind the counter and one other person working the tables.

The menu is small and limited. Toast, Oats, Soup, Salad, Baked Goods (although barely anything when we there), a meat or veggie sandwich, flatbread, grilled cheese, french toast, pop corn and ice cream. As you can see- it's very bread-centric. If you're looking for bacon and eggs or anything brunchy you're at the wrong place.

The french toast feature that day was made with bananas, whipped cream and pecans I believe. $12 I think. That's what I ended up ordering as it was the closest thing to a brunch item I could find. The dish was okay - nothing special for the price point. The grapes that came on the side were old, gross and sad and should not have been served.

My husband also couldn't find anything to his liking so he ended up ordering the meat sandwich for $9.The sandwich boasts being on a toasted house made roll. To me that implies it is made with at least warm bread and hopefully fresh ingredients. Sadly it was gross. They took the lone sandwich in the display case, put it on a plate with a few veggie sticks and popcorn. It was neither warm, nor fresh. We actually had to bring it back up to complain and the lady behind the counter argued that they make everything fresh. She gave me the option of having it heated up or to make a fresh one. How considerate?! Not. First, the customer is usually right and secondly, you don't ask how to make it better - you do it, and with some appreciation - not attitude. Needless to say, that left a bad taste in our mouths. Poor customer service. When the ""newly made"" sandwich arrived, it was just as bad - with a dry crumbly bun. My husband ate it anyways since he was starving at this point and I had shared half my french toast with him already.

They don't have any juice available save for the bottled kind in the fridge. So if you're looking for a glass of juice you'd be disappointed.

That's the theme of this review - disappointed. And no need to go back anytime soon. Sorry",3.4631250000000002,1.0,negative,16

Our table had 2 young babies. The lady, who I believe is the owner because I saw her in the news- came up to our table and said that ""no outside food was allowed"". We quickly let her know that it was baby's food that we had laid out. She then proceeded to emphasize that that was the rule, and that ""everything you need for your baby is available here."" She must not understand that young babies don't eat food off the menu...so we choose to forgive her ignorance. 
As I pick up my drink and food at the counter, the same lady again presses: ""the kids menu is available on the side"". I tell her that the babies are on restricted diets, and there is control on what they eat, and she responds in a somewhat condescending way by saying ""we can make whatever it is that you need, even if it's puréed bananas""... umm no thanks, I don't put the trust of a baby's diet in someone else's hands and no our table isn't going to pay you to mash some bananas.

But that's all fairly moot if the food isn't good, but luckily The Nook provides some very tasty eats. My preschooler and I shared a chocolate banana muffin and an apple cinnamon one, and they were almost too much for the two of us. Emphasis on the 'almost'. I had a latte and it was delicious.

Out of all the bakeries on Broadway, I think this is the oldest. So I wanted to like this established place.

The staff was very accommodating. Pleasant, and they described the cookies that they were selling.

Unfortunately, none of the things I ordered today tasted fresh. They tasted day old, even though I came in the morning, it looked like stuff from yesterday was sitting there. I'm finding out that the thing you need to order there is donuts, but a bakery should have fresh bread, and biscuits. 

The biscuits I ordered tasted old. Dry, but in a bad way. I don't mind a crumbly biscuit, but there's crumbly in a good way, or crumbly like it's been sitting on the shelf a couple of days. They we're in a plastic bag, so that should have been a dead giveaway. I ended up throwing them away. I would avoid ordering them unless you knew exactly when they were made. 

I also ordered cookies, and they tasted like they were pre-made to be frosted later. 

I didn't smell anything cooking in the store. I didn't smell bread, I didn't smell cookies. With other choices literally right up the block, that serve fresh baked goods, you may be better served visiting Crave or Just Cookies.",4.157058823529412,1.77,negative,17

Chicken Wings, It was obvious that the grease was old, because the wings were so dark yet not over cooked. They were bland & hardly edible. 

Seafood Salad - Nothing but cut up imitation crab meat, mayo, with old bay season. Not horrible, but not what I would consider seafood salad. 

Salmon Platter - Small portion of Salmon, a bit bland but not over cooked. Potatoes cooked just right but absolutely no flavor. Big piece of broccoli drenched in minced garlic, butter, and a hint of lemon. Now that I think about it, the whole platter was covered in minced garlic.. (Shaking my head).

How can I put my feelings for you into words? You're my go to spot during the week, but then you shut me out on weekends? Was it something I ordered? I don't understand why you don't want to hang out once the work week comes to an end. Your fresh lettuce, perfectly seasoned croutons and delicious chunks of white meat chicken keep me coming back again and again. I even made the ultimate commitment when I put your card in my pocket and called myself a member of your royalty rewards. Little did I know you were getting familiar with all the neighborhood wallets, not just mine. And then you have the nerve to keep stringing me along, always seeming to find an occasion to send me a free meal voucher once a month, sometimes twice, depending on how often I throw money at you. Though it may seem like our relationship is all take at times on my part, I assure you, it is one of the longest and most stable relationships I've ever had. I walk in, see your shining faces light up in familiarity and you immediately go to work assembling my custom creation that I have come to crave weekly. At times we don't even have to exchange words in order to know that we are on the same page. Oh, and did I mention your hauntingly tasty wheat rolls? An oblong orb of crustiness shaped around a warm, soft, perfectly doughy center, the consummate companion to scoop up some leafy greens. If only you were open weekends I could see us being a perfect five star couple. Despite the dimming of that one star, I hope you find comfort in knowing that no matter how hectic or stressful my day has been, there is no lunch that I long for more than the salad that you and I have brought into this world.
Yours,

Upon letting out a long very audible sigh she finally agreed to do what i had asked.   After a brief very NON audible phone conversation the employee then hangs up the phone  and with that same loving blank stare says ""we don't have a list"".   (all we needed to know is if there was any gluten in the dressings, as my friend is in fact a glutard).   At this point my salad is already made and she is eager to wait on another customer.   She abruptly tells me the total without a hint of customer service in her voice.  I proceed to pay and then ask her if i can get the salad ""to go"" as my glutard buddy cannot eat at this establishment.   She then throws the lid and a bag on top of the plate and walks away. (seriously threw it down like the beginning of a schoolyard fight)    Come on already.   I understand a bad day, I have had plenty, but just home then (your manager did).

After calling it in, I drove there on my way home, and arrived just as it was coming out of the pressure fryer. It looked dark bronze and the odor of the steam being released went right to my head, and made me feel a bit intoxicated. 

Nothing wrong with that!

I watched as the cook removed the chicken and transferred it to an aluminum tray for safe travel. I counted the pieces with him, and think my package carried 17 total. I appreciated the extra generosity. He then wrapped the tray in foil, and tore open the top dome to allow the condensation to escape. In turn, that was placed in a heavy gauge brown paper sack, and again split open at the top for additional moisture release. 

By the time I arrived home, I was nearly overcome by the aroma enveloping the car. I decided to sample a wing while still hot and wait for the family before consuming more. First bite encountered crisp skin, followed by warm white meat and a pleasant clean oil fried chicken flavor. I nibbled and sucked all the meat from them bones, and I selfishly considered grabbing a plump breast for a long moment. 

Nah! It would be more fun to indulge with the fam. So, I waited. 

An hour later we were sitting around the kitchen table with sides of homemade mashed potatoes and green salad as excellent complementary pieces to a very happy meal. 

A star is missing because truth be told, the chicken was a tad overdone. A lighter golden copper finish would have made it perfect. Turns out that as much as I love the color bronze, it is past prime when it comes to fried chicken excellence. Still very good texture and taste, but with a subtle aftertaste that missed the mark. 

In fried chicken, even a seconds can make a big difference.",3.6692307692307695,3.32,neutral,13

I have never entered a store that smells so appetizing before. And appetizing it is...

Victoria's house-smoked meats are incredible. They have a wide array of sausage, ham, and bacon products, along with many other deli meats and cheeses. There is a mini-grocery section in the store that includes a fridge full of homemade Ukrainian food. A selection of deli sandwiches is also available (there is a row of stools near the window, for anyone who can't wait until they get home before eating).

If you're a bacon lover (and who isn't?), I highly recommend the cold smoked black forest bacon. It is without hyperbole, the best bacon I have ever tasted. And at about $6.25 per lb, it's about the same price you'd pay for inferior bacon at the grocery store.

The ham nugget is also a quality product: a very smokey chunk of ham that adds a very rich flavour to homemade split pea soup.

The service at Victoria is very friendly. I'm a very new customer, but I feel like they treat me as though I've been a regular for years. With the quality of the meat and the friendliness of the employees, I will definitely be a regular for as long as I live in the neighbourhood (and I'll probably continue to patronize the deli even if I move elsewhere in the city).",4.08,4.43,positive,15

They even sold four or five types of head cheese (note that head cheese has no cheese in it) so I bought some even though no one else in my family will eat it.  There's endless kinds of sausages and a great selection of pepperoni so I bought a little of both.  The pepperoni is the second best I've ever tasted (you will have to read my reviews to find the best pepperoni in Edmonton). A steady flow of customers gave me confidence that everything is fresh. I found the prices better than reasonable for all of the common as well as exotic variations of European meats. In fact my bill was under   $25.00 for a bag full of meats and that included lunch.

I have no idea what that was about but it created a very unsettling atmosphere. This was during the Covid peak but still, if a store is open, it should be open otherwise just don't bother.

When we went more recently (March 2021), the door was not locked. We were the only ones in there at one point but then two people who came in after were assisted first. That's just plain rude as we were quite clearly standing there waiting for help with the oil.

Furthermore, upon reviewing my receipt, I noticed I was charged for something I did not buy. I called the store and although she did immediately refund the item, there was no apology whatsoever. So not only did she charge me for an additional item, but she didn't even apologize for it.

The woman was more interested in me filling out a survey for what great service that she had not provided, than actually providing it.

The salads are always half wilted. Whoever does the precut fruit kinda sucks at. Maybe rotate people who do it, because it's the most boring combos. Other stores do a better job with the produce department than this location. Field trip might help.

Almost weekly they stop stocking products I regularly buy. I've complained to employees about this and they've responded that it surprises and frustrates them too, because high-selling items get discontinued as frequently as low-selling items.

It seems like someone somewhere is letting certain brands have a monopoly with little competition. For instance, this store used to carry many different brands of potato chips in the natural section, and now the entire section is all just Kettle Brand or Kroger's private label items. Just recently I've noticed that the nut milk section has been almost completely taken over by Silk brand products. 

Also, for the past few months, the fresh roasted chicken is always between production times at 5:20, when I arrive there after work. This never used to be a problem. There is always a crowd of people waiting around for the next batch, which isn't ready until about 5:45, and the deli roasted pieces are also always sold out.

Ordered a Stromboli and because they have the word tomato pie in their name a small tomato pie. 

Ate half the  tomato pie on the drive home.
It is not your standard Sicilian style crust but your thinner in New York style. The sauce was thick hearty flavorful and clearly made with fresh garlic.

I usually buy these items though speciality items change so make sure you check out their weekly ads online before you go:

*German chocolates for ~ $1.69 per bar (varies) 
* Eggs
* Coffee (instant coffee $2.99 for 16 ounces)
* Milk
* Half n Half (Friendly Farms brand is rich and delish!)
* Fresh vegetables
* Frozen vegetables
* Ice cream
* Frozen pizza
* Frozen pies
* Frozen cakes

I used to shop at WalMart for most of my groceries but now I shop at Aldi. Why pay more??? It is owned by the brother of Trade Joe's. Quality is obvious in their products and service and they treat their employees with a livable wage.

Make sure you bring a quarter for their shopping carts. You put one in the slot then when you are done you link a chain to it which will remove the quarter so you get your quarter back.

Make sure you bring your own shopping bags! They have some for sale but better to bring your own. If not you can pick up empty boxes throughout the store if you forget.

They cut me off in the middle of ordering and asked me to come to the window. He asked me what size meal I wanted again and I showed him my coupon that said free fries and shake. Then he asked me what size chicken I wanted when I had ordered a kids meal. I repeated back my whole order and showed him the coupon a second time. He said ok and looked through a bunch of paperwork trying to ring me up. He took my payment and handed me a receipt charging me full price for all my food with just $1 off at the bottom. I told him he didn't take off my birthday coupon and he said ""oh I thought it was just $1 off"" when I had shown it to him twice. I asked him to refund me and correct it. He tried several times and didn't ask anyone else for help. He finally just gave me cash which I'm sure messed up the register because I paid with a card. This whole time my daughter is screaming in the back because it's taking so long. By the time I got my food it was cold and took way too long for no one else being in line in front of me.

As soon as we walked in, I noticed the Black Forest cake in the case. Black Forest is not readily available around here, and it's a favorite of mine. I put it in my mental checklist of ""eat before you go"" and off we went to our table.

Okay, the decor here leaves a lot to be desired. But what they lack in aesthetic style they make up for in service. The people are so friendly here. 

The portions here are HUGE. They also bring out fresh bread they make onsite and meals come with soup or salad. The honey mustard dressing is really good.

I ordered the fried chicken and it was HOT and delicious.Our friend ordered from the Senior's menu and they brought her three very large pieces of fish. My mom ordered a Reuben. She could only eat half of it.

Though I was stuffed, I went ahead and ordered that Black Forest cake. Those cherries burst in my mouth with the flavor of a mighty tasty liqueur. Definitely moist and delicious.

Sign on door said new owners/hours.  Have been here many times in the past, they had always been open during dinner every night.  Now they are only open for dinner Fri/Sat.  Upon walking in the door I was looking over their list of specials, there were quite a few to choose from.  Another board listed their desserts.

Didn't see an employee or a sign about seating so I chose a spot.  There were 2 other tables, I bet I waited at least 7 minutes before my presence was acknowledged, and this after 2 different servers walked to the other tables.  I was about to walk out when one approached and took my order.

I chose the Mostaccioli which came with texas toast and soup or salad.  I chose salad with 1000 Island dressing.  I ordered sweet tea with lemon.

The tea was really good, some of the best I have had for a while.  The salad arrived with a basket of crackers that I have to say weren't the freshest in the world.  Salad consisted of iceberg, big quarter slices of tomatoes, croutons, shredded cheese and a good amount of dressing.  Had to cut the lettuce into smaller pieces (no biggie), and the croutons were stale, hard.  The mostaccioli came and there was a a good portion.  When the waitress, who had her hands full, dropped it off she placed the parmesan shaker on the table upside down.  I had to giggle.  I was asked when my order was taken if I wanted the meat sauce, as opposed to the marinara.  Of course I chose the meat sauce, although while eating it I was hard pressed to find much meat.  It had good flavor, though, and had a small amount of cheese melted on top.

Declined dessert due to being stuffed, took leftovers home, when I looked at the bill I was shocked!!  $3.99 for the food,, $1.89 for drink.  I literally ate dinner for $6.

Who would have thought an Italian restaurant would be a place to go for breakfast? I sure wouldn't. If it were not for, The Telegraph a local newspaper during an article on the best places for breakfast in the River Bend area, I would have never discovered Mama Mia's. 

I ordered the, Mama Mia's Breakfast. It included; two eggs, two strips of bacon, two sausage links and two pancakes. Wow! That is a farmers breakfast in my mind and it was so filling. I had my eggs scrambled and they were extra fluffy. My bacon was freshly prepared and straight. I hate it when my bacon is all twisted up when dining out. The links of sausage were seasoned well and I liked the grill marks on them.  

Everything in my breakfast was good, but the star of the meal definitely was the pancakes. They were a light golden color on both sides (yes, I look). They were so warm, that when I added my butter, it started to melt instantly. Best of all, the Maple Syrup was served warm. I have not had warm syrup brought to my table since I moved to this side of the river. The warm syrup is what got them bumped up to 5 Stars. 

My coffee was prepared the way I like it, strong and black. Best of all, my cup was never less than half full. My server and his co-workers were very attentive to everyones needs. Speaking of my server, he was very friendly, professional and made me feel welcomed on my first visit.

I commend the restaurant and staff on making the dining experience safe during this pandemic. They encourage social distancing, provided hand sanitizer and did a thorough job cleaning tables and booths as guest departed.

Well, from first glance, they got the cheese right.  It was gooey, greasy and melted perfectly.  The sauce was tangy and sweet and they put just the right amount on it.

. . but the crust.  Isn't it usually the crust?  The crust just wasn't crispy enough...it was oddly flaky in certain spots.

Upon first walking in, there's a big menu board above the front counter so I wasn't sure if this was a ""walk up and order your own food"" type place. Confusion dissolved quickly when my friend and I were greeted and invited to take a seat. Apparently you can also walk up to the counter and place a to-go order.

Like every Mexican restaurant I've ever visited, a basket of chips were brought to the table while we decided what to order. Chips were disappointingly inconsistent... many were fried nicely, but many were on the chewy side and not fried all the way. Although I give them credit for homemade chips. We ended up getting a Barbacoa (Stewed Goat) Taco, Lengua (Beef Tongue) Taco, Chile Rellenos, and Al Pastor Torta. Both tacos were prepared nicely and had great flavor. In my experience with Chile Rellenos, the poblano pepper is overpowered by the filling. The way they prepare it here is with great care to make sure the pepper is present on the palette and balanced well with all the other ingredients and is served with delicious yellow rice. The Torta wasn't the best I've ever had, but was still very good. It was accompanied by nicely prepared fries.

There is a salsa bar with 6-7 salsas ranging in spice from not spicy to very spicy. I favored the top end of the spicy salsas which aren't actually that spicy, but are very flavorful. The bottom end of the salsas were a little bland in my personal opinion. The service was excellent and made the dining experience very enjoyable. He went the extra mile and described how the salsas were made when I inquired about them. Great food, great service, and great prices that I would definitely come back for.",3.226875,2.96,neutral,16

However, I took the leap of faith of other reviews and headed up North Armenia. My boyfriend and I almost missed the restaurant, as it is in a small strip mall. Aesthetically, it isn't anything to write home about. However, I've found through past experiences, that many of the great, authentic restaurants lack curb appeal. I ordered a combination platter, which included a cheese enchilada, mini beef chimichanga, beef taco, refried beans and rice. All for a measly $8.49! It was great, boasting authentic flavor and not disappointing. My boyfriend decided to go the taco route, which rings in at a nice $2 per taco. You can choose from a variety of meat fillings, including marinated pork, chicken, steak, barbacoa, tripe, ground beef, and chorizo to name a few. 
I've been back a few times, and each time it has lived up to my expectations. The last time I went, I ordered 4 tacos and 2 Coronas... $15! What a steal, and what a great meal! Highly recommend to anyone! Best Mexican food I've had in Tampa.",3.226875,3.57,neutral,16

After reading all the reviews about El Zarape, I was excited to try the place.  I usually love Mexican food.  Big flavors, lots of food, what's not to love?  As much as I want to love this place, my experience was absolutely dismal and I can honestly say that I will never be back.

My friend organized this dinner for a large group of 16 of us two weeks in advance.  She even called twice the week of to modify the number to make sure it was correct.  Therefore, they had ample warning that a group this large was coming and should have been prepared.  When we arrived, they did not even have the correct number of silverware on the table (which is not a huge deal, but when our food came and half of us still did not have silverware, it became a nuisance.  Also, that showed us how unprepared they were, which we realized as the meal went on).  

There were around 3 other couples in the place when our group trickled in.  They gave us plenty of time to look at the menu and by plenty of time, I mean way too much time.  Luckily, we are a chatty bunch, so waiting a long time for them to take our orders was not a huge deal at the beginning.  They have only three types of beer, but they also serve homemade sangria and it was delicious.  It was almost like a slushy, but I enjoyed it.  We believe they even put cinnamon in it.  

Once our orders were taken, that was when the real waiting began.  There was only one extremely surly young woman server (I swear I did not see a change of expression from her the entire night) and one chef who I believe might have been the owner.  We waited about an hour to an hour and a half for our food.   What I mean by the range is that half our table got their food in about an hour and the other half got it about half an hour later (our group was split into two tables).  By the time one table was done, the other table was still waiting!

The menu also proved to be confusing.  My friend ordered a fajita quesadilla, thinking it was a fajita, when really it was a quesadilla with fajita filling.  My fiance ordered a burrito enchilada, thinking it was an enchilada, but it was a burrito with enchilada sauce on it.  They kept messing up people's orders.  I didn't want sour cream with my vegetable quesadilla, but they forgot.  My fiance didn't want sour cream either, but it came covered in sour cream.  It was very obvious that they were not ready to handle these orders.

The worst part of the night, was my fiance could not even eat the burrito.  He calls it ""absolutely the most disgusting thing I've ever eaten"".  I tried it and it was completely tasteless to me.  Both of us are not snobs when it comes to food and, honestly, we will eat most things.  But neither of us would eat that burrito.  My quesadilla was fine and alone I would give it 2-3 stars.  The major problem was the bell peppers were burned, so I took them out.  My fiance ended up sending back the burrito.  However, after he sent it back saying he would not eat it, neither the chef or the waitress acknowledged this and apologized at the time, instead choosing to completely ignore it.  I would have appreciated them even asking if he would like something else.  He ended up leaving eating nothing but the chips at the table.

While we were sitting there waiting for the other half of the table to finish their food, we noticed a bug crawling on the wall behind us.  My other friend said with 100% certainty that it was a baby cockroach.  By that time, we were ready to leave.

At the cash register, the chef finally acknowledged that my fiance did not eat his meal and comped him the two beers he drank.  Honestly, I think he should have comped our entire meal.  He was a very nice man, which made me wish I could like this place, but his sudden charm at the end of the meal could not make up for the rest of it.

In summary, if you ever come here with a large group, expect long wait times, differing times getting food, disgusting food, messed up orders, and cockroach spotting.  We will not be back.",3.226875,1.0,negative,16

I called to see about dinner here for a large group since it's located across the street from Pin Chasers, where we had planned a get together afterwards. The owner said they could accommodate large groups, so we booked two adjacent tables. I knew the place was small, but it is REALLY small. As in, besides our two large tables or 8, there were only three other tables or 2-4 for people to sit at. Our group easily doubled his business for the night. 

There were two employees running the entire place. The owner was also the server and the cook and the cashier. Not sure how they expected to cook 16 meals and get them on the table in a timely manner, but it just didn't happen. In fact, one entire table had food, while the other table watched us eat. I finished my food before the other table got theirs. The other employee was a young girl, who looked like she hated being there. Her face might have been plastic, because she wore the same expression on her face all night. We asked for silverware and got two sets, when we needed 9 sets more. At one point, I was ready to go in the kitchen and wash my own set of silverware so that my friends at the next table could eat, since their food arrived FINALLY and they had no fork to eat it with! 

As for the food, my meal was fine. I had a steak fajita quesadilla (which seemed like one large tortilla folded over, whereas most mexican restaurants put two tortillas together to make the quesadilla), and one of my friends got carne asada and said it was good. All the burritos didn't get much fanfare, and anyone that made changes to their meal basically ruined their meal, because it ended up burned in some way, shape, or form, or just plain nasty. One in our party said his was not edible and did not eat. Chips and salsa were good. Just nothing special. 

I'm guessing they don't have a liquor license, as they only serve 3 beers and a sangria (made in house). The sangria was tasty, but a lot of ice was added, which was unnecessary. While there, they ran out of 1 beer, which limited our choices even more. 

The night was capped off with a visit from a baby cockroach climbing the wall behind us. Sigh. Probably would not have noticed him if we hadn't been sitting there so long, but alas, he came out to keep us company while we waited for our two hour dinner ordeal to come to an end. 

We were told to go to the register to pay, where our jack-of-all-trades owner rang us out by having us tell him what we had (honor system?). For 2 bottled beers, 2 sangrias, a fajita quesadilla, and a burrito, it was around $35. But he didn't charge us extra for the cockroach entertainment, or the sorrow and shame I felt for choosing this place to bring my 15 friends to. Oh, and then his credit card machine wouldn't work. He had 8 couples waiting to pay, and the machine was down. Luckily we all had cash so we could get out of there pronto.

Except for one small fact..... El Zerape is no longer El Zerape.........it is now Jalapeno Mexican Grill.

OK, this gets complicated, so bear with me.....

*rolls over a big wipe-off board and starts diagraming the situation*

El Zerape went out of business, and so a new group of people decided to move in and take over the old location. Now the new owner used to run a very successful Mexican restaurant on Bruce B. Downs in Land O' Lakes called Jalapeno Mexican Grill. The people who owned Jalapeno's decided to close their old restaurant on Bruce B. Downs and relocate everything to the new location on Armenia Avenue. And so.......if you're looking for El Zerape, it's no longer there. And if you're looking for Jalapeno's on Bruce B. Downs, they are no longer there. Instead you'll now find Jalapeno's at 4820 Armenia Avenue.  Whew!

Jalapeno's is located on Armenia between Hillsborough Avenue and MLK Boulevard. It's directly across the street from Pin Chasers, which is really nice in case you want to bowl off that extra bean burrito after lunch!

Jalapeno's serves truly authentic Mexican cuisine with a menu that reflects the bold, rich flavors of the chef and owner's native Mexico City. This is not Tex-Mex or Cali-Mex, but rather a family-owned restaurant serving the type of home cooking that you would experience south of the border.

Chef Miguel Espinosa features well-known favorites such as tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas and fajitas, as well as traditional plates such as mole poblano, carnitas, chiles rellenos, and ensalada de nopales (cactus salad). The meals are served with fresh, hand-made corn tortillas and homemade salsas (tomatillo, chipotle, or chile de arbol), and their seafood dishes are made with fresh Gulf shrimp and fish (catch of the day). They also offer homemade desserts, including flan and arroz con leche (rice pudding), that are made on premises from Espinosa family recipes. 

I had chicken enchiladas with red sauce today. They were very tasty, and the sauce had a nice smoky heat. 

The new restaurant has only been in place for about 3 weeks, and they are still going through their soft opening as they get everything moved down to the new location, and finish training their staff. The lady who was our server was excellent, and we talked at length about their homemade mole sauce which is made from about 40 different ingredients, and takes several days to prepare.

I'm looking forward to a return visit after they finish settling in to this new location.",3.226875,2.7699999999999996,neutral,16

The nachos were burnt, and my burrito was awkwardly plated (it was in a small tortilla and not wrapped at all) and much too salty. Perhaps I should have just stuck with the tacos, as I usually do.

The menu at this location is a bit simpler. For instance, they don't have the other location's great mole sauce. It seems like the purpose of this location is to be more of a bar or club that happens to also serve food, where as the other one is more focused on the food.

I had a groupon I had to use that expired that night so my boyfriend and I decided to go - it was around 8:15 by the time we arrived and according to the website, they close at 9pm. Needless to say, upon arrival, there were only a handful of tables still finishing up their meals and by the time we finished, we were clearly the last. Despite this, our meal and experience was surprisingly memorable!

Highlights for us:
- Our server (he was a previous customer of theirs who loved their food so much he decided to help out at the restaurant), was excellent - his passion for the food transferred into excitement for me and although he was upfront when I asked if he tried certain foods, and he had not, he still had a charming way to him. (I can't comment about any other server as he was the only one working the floor by the time we arrived)

- The sopa de Azteca (Aztec Soup) was deeeee-licious! Seriously, I love chicken tortilla soup and I've tried several varieties over the years, but this version?  It's what will bring me back there in a heartbeat


Improvements:
- The space was lacking atmosphere and excitement. The colorful walls were a nice touch - somewhat sloppily executed though - but even though there were pops of color everywhere, the ceiling - painted all black - felt oppressive and heavy. The numerous TVs were off, the music was low in volume for most of the night. I wanted there to be happiness, music and liveliness so much  - like a fiesta!


Overall though,  I would gladly go back and visit Cafe Del Sol, do not let the location put you off - if you get the same server we had, I'm sure you'll be in good hands =)",2.7564285714285717,3.17,neutral,14

What can I say - new digs but same great food! Bonus points because we no longer have to drive all the way to ghetto east side to get good Mexican!

We went for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon and the place is located right along the Yellowhead, in the strip mall where there is a McDonalds. I'm not sure what the place was before (pool hall maybe?) but it is definitely much more spacious than the old digs. The place is bright and has a bunch of mexican flags and decor set up throughout the space.

Anyways, for food, we may have over ordered (if that's a thing):

Appetizers
- Calamares ($13) - lightly dusted and fried calamari that came with a jalapeno dip (not spicy). It was a bit on the small size but they were just as described.
- Ceviche ($13) - red snapper with pico di gallo, lime, a light clamoto broth and totopos. This dish grew on us the more spoonfuls we ate of it. Pretty good ceviche for Edmonton standards. Had a couple peppers mixed in that gave the dish a slight kick to it.

Entrees
- Chipotle chicken quesadilla ($14) - polla tinga with sauteed bell peppers and onions. I've had their quesadilla before - this one was good but could have used more crunch/crispiness to it. It came with a side of beans (not pictured).
- Pez tacos ($14) - lightly battered fish, shredded cabbage slaw, pico di gallo and jalapeno aioli. We all agreed that the fish needed some sort of spice/flavour to it. It was very, very plain even with the side of guacamole that we orderded with it. Won't be getting this one next time.
- El Chancho torta ($14) - two chorizo patties with grilled pineapple, jalapeno mayo and cheese. All stuffed into a satisfying ciabatta bun with lettuce and tomato. The chorizo patties were spot on and the spice they put on it was just plain delicious. We ordered a side of fries with it (they were undercooked but it's a Mexican joint, so they are forgiven).
- Carnitas ($16) - this was everyone's favourite dish of the day! Slow roasted pork served with cilantro and onions. The carnitas looked a bit on the dry side but looks are deceiving. They were tender and jam packed with flavour. Sooooo good. We ordered the sauteed onions as the side (a must!)

The waitress we had was awesome! I'm not sure why but they have limited service for lunch - there's a buffet on for $13/person but we wanted to order a la carte. The kitchen were out of certain things (we tried to order their nachos but no dice).

The jalepeno sauce was perfect with it. I wanted to lick every last drop of sauce out of the bowl but I resisted the urge in an attempt to look civilized. I regret that decision. Sauce like that should not be wasted! We had the carnitas, carmerones, and the steak with mushrooms. All three were good, but the camerones and steak had more favour than the carnitas.

We started eating at this restaurant years ago when they were in their first location a few blocks south of Londonderry Mall, and followed them to their new location right on the Yellowhead and 142 St. Cinthia and her husband's passion IS Cafe del Sol and it shows in the attention to perfectly done dishes and attentive service they provide customers. We had the four mini-taco dishes, and the Enchiladas, and they rocked! The only thing I would suggest is bottles of hot sauce on each table, as they purposely don't over-spice their food so as not to offend customers who don't like too much heat.

NOTE: I do NOT know what some people on this site are unhappy about, service-wise, because we have ALWAYS had good service at Cafe del Sol. Please come down and let them show you. A new server has been hired and Cinthia is totally dedicated to pleasing everyone. Unfortunately as we all know , you CAN'T please everyone.

What you SHOULD do in any restaurant is let the manager on duty know immediately about anything you are unhappy about-- right then and there--so the restaurant has a chance to make it right for you and you leave happy.

It was pretty busy when my boyfriend and I arrived (around 7pm) - all the tables in the front were occupied, and half the tables in the back too. The place has been spruced up somewhat - the same colorful walls exist, but now they're adorned with kitschy Mexican items like sombreros, dresses, flags, and lights. But it looks better than it did previously.

We each ordered the Sopa de Azteca for $7 (since it was a big hit last time), along with some chips & salsa $4, and also shared an order of tacos el pastor (pork with pineapple) $13. For drinks, I ordered the lime margarita $9 (expensive!!) and the boyfriend ordered a beer $6.25 (he wanted one on draft - as indicated on the menu - but were told they didn't have beer on draft).

Highlights: I'm happy to report the soup was still very yummy - I think the portion even got a little larger. It has some good heat to it so be forewarned. The chips were made in house and the salsa also had some kick to it. The tacos we ordered were excellent & executed well! The order came with 4 tacos and a small portion of refried beans & rice. Overall - we were quite happy with our food choices - the prices were a bit expensive though in our opinion.

Downfalls: Service - was adequate but not super pleasant. Our server did her job but was a bit slow but that's to be expected I guess. Also, my lime margarita was pretty gross - it was definitely made with some sort of artificial lime powder (as I could taste it wasn't made with fresh lime).... and there was way too much ice so it ended up tasting like a watery artificial lime drink. I only took a couple sips and my boyfriend had to finish it for me. For $9 it was very disappointing and very different from the yummy ones we had previously.

Overall, would still go back for some soup & tacos but definitely stay away from their margaritas.",2.7564285714285717,3.17,neutral,14

They seem to be proliferating in the NJ/Pa area, and I'm finding it difficult to keep up with all of them. The actual winery that is the parent to this tasting room is about 40 miles away from the PV location. And just one more winery that I was not aware of.

This room may have escaped my wine-dar too had it not been for the sign that advertised jalapeño wine. It is tucked away in a not prime location, but signs steered us towards it. As we approached we noted a few tables with chairs outside, and some strands of lights framing the entrance.

Once inside I was happy to see the typical wine tasting room bar, but this one had chairs too. Also a few tables with chairs. I think I prefer this set up over the more common scenario that I usually see which is no chairs. However it can become a more bar type atmosphere with people monopolizing the chairs and not allowing other patrons the opportunity to learn about and taste the wines. On this night it was not a deterrent even though there was one group of drinkers who seemed to be camped out for a considerable time.

Glancing at the menu I noticed 2 things, each individual taste is $1, and the majority of wines were sweet fruit based offerings. But closer inspection revealed there are some dry offerings and even a tawny port( ruby port too) My aunt and I sidled up to the bar and began a small tasting.

Together we sampled about 5 items, starting with dry whites. The Sauvignon Blanc was ok, the Gewurtztraminer was fair at best. Then a dry red Meritage style that was ok too. Finishing with pumpkin that was very surprising, tart and not too sweet, and it definitely tasted like squash with spice notes. I never had anything like it, and would possibly buy it as unique offering for people to taste with holiday desserts. Last sip was the tawny port that was actually very good, it was a blend of barrels that had been aging since the early 2000's. 

There were several other fruit based wines we would have liked to try, but decided another visit would be the time for that. Sadly their rhubarb wine was not available at this location, but the friendly and knowledgeable server told me if I called ahead he would bring one in. I plan on taking him up on this offer. And I would be remiss if I didn't try the jalapeño on my next visit. I'm very close to being a fan of this wine, and further testing may bump this up to 4 stars. Perhaps the biggest obstacle was the cost, most bottles were $18 or more, and I didn't notice mention of case discounts as other local wineries offer. The Tawny port was about that price but for a 375 ml bottle. Pretty steep IMO. The pours were a decent size, so come here yourself with a friend or two and sample several. 3.75 go local Yelps",3.24375,2.35,neutral,16

The heat was real but it went away fast. The Brie cheese and crackers, extra $$, worked nicely with this wine. No dumping jugs were seen but we were not having a marathon tasting so that was ok. Others in our group, there were four of us, liked the tawny port and whiskey flavored wine.

It was low key.  Glasses were not washed out after each taste but quickly turned upside down by the pourer. Considering the wide variety of flavored wines on offer this was unfortunate. No water was offered but bottled water could be purchased. The pourer knew the wines and winemaker and told the story.

With a bit of preference for dry wines, we really enjoyed the Chambourcin. It was dry and smooth and our favorite that we tried. The Sauvignon Blanc was pretty good too, but we weren't as crazy about the Gewürztraminer or the Chambourcin Rose. The spicy strawberry was only okay. We didn't try the jalapeño wine, but the couple next to us said it burned all the way down.

There were a few other couples sampling with us, and our service was good, but usually when we sampled wines in the past, they tell us facts about the wine and how it's made when they pour it- and they didn't do that here. We kind of felt more like customers for wine than guests to a winery, which was a little disappointing.

I honestly don't know how I've missed this place before. It's been here for about three years. 

We noticed the huge jalapeño signs scattered about in the village, promoting their jalapeño wine! We were so intrigued!! So was everyone else in the tasting room. It was all people were asking for! 

They suggest you sample this one last because of the spice. The smell of the jalapeño was so strong I didn't know if I was even going to be able to finish the small pour (think top of a medicine cap). I did and it was delish! Very different and a lot less spicy than I anticipated... but in a good way. The friendly, knowledgeable bartender/sommelier suggested pairing with sharp cheese cheese and crackers as well as using it for Bloody Marys instead of tequila and in margaritas too. I could definitely see all of that working well. This wine is made strictly with jalapeño and no grapes. Very inventive and creative!! It's $25 a bottle and sure to be a topic of conversation and an impressive bottle to share at a party. 

They have many other very interesting unusual wines, seasonal ones too. So many unique wines I don't know that I would even bother with your standard wines here. The agave was really tasting a refreshing. It was like a margarita! The Black Forest, their rich decadent dessert wine was a treat also! Reminiscent of the cake of the same name.  

The place is basically a bar type atmosphere with some seating outside. I would love to come back and go for an entire glass (priced around $8) on another gorgeous fall day or maaaaaaybe a wine slushee on a hot day.

We went here during the festival yesterday. $1 sampling's and the glasses of wine range around $7 to $10. 

I tried their jalapeño wine, which I loved. It's pretty spicy, so make sure you sample it before buying. My husband wouldn't drink it.. he said it was heartburn in a bottle.

Their vino tequila, eh, it was not my favorite. 

I saw their $6 cheese plate. It had 4 different cheese. It could of had a little better presentation.

The guy working there had no idea about the yelp offer for the free wine tasting, but went with it. 

He wasn't overly friendly and didn't really explain any of the wines we sampled. I felt like we were bothering him by being there, and when we left he made a comment that we were there so early. They were also out of 3 of the wines I wanted to sample, the jalapeño, strawberry, and the Black Forest cake. The Black Forest cake was the one I really wanted to try too. I sampled the raspberry wine- good but almost sickening sweet. I also got the cupuacu which had cocoa, pineapple, bubble gum, and banana. It was interesting. My husband hates banana and bubble gum so I made him try it but it really didn't taste like bubble gum or banana that much. 

My husband got the whiskey mead and that was delicious. We bought a bottle to take home. We also tried the agave wine- definitely tasted straight up like tequila. It would be good for making margaritas but I wouldn't drink it by itself. The bartender also gave us a sample of the nutty sailor port because he said it was close to the Black Forest cake. It tasted similar to a chocolate wine we had before. We bought a bottle of that also. Prices were a little high at over $20 per bottle and the bottles were smaller than normal. But they do have a lot of unique flavors. If we happen to be in the area again maybe we will try to come back for the Black Forest cake wine.",3.24375,2.26,neutral,16

I had high hopes for this place as love these kinda Cajun crab boil places and been to a ton around the country but this experience was terrible. 

Let's start with the manager..very smug and rude. I called before hand and asked if they served alcohol and they said no, then I asked if we could bring out on beer, and they said yes. Very enthusiastically actually ""yes, of course you can!""  So we did, sat down and my wife popped open her beer. But a min or two after the manager very loudly and very rudely came over and said hey I know you just opened that but you can't drink that here..we don't have our byob license yet. Please finish that one but don't open any more! I was like, well we called before and they told us it was fine and we could. Still he was very smug and the (white) manager was like ""well..they (nodding to the Asian staff at front desk) probably don't understand"". This kinda felt distasteful to me. If your the manager, take ownership of the issue and don't pass the blame. And the fact he was so loud and aggressive and not discreet about it with others around led to my wife and us feeling very embarrassed and put a total bad feeling on the meal. Def could have handled better. 

But the worst offense was the food. It was like SO bland, zero seasoning and tasteless! So bizarre for this type of place and def the worst I've had at this type of place. I got the ""special"" which is a mix of all the sauces, so you'd think would be packed with flavor but was just oddly watered down, completely lacking in salt (or msg or whatever) and no flavor at all!! No chunks of garlic or taste of spice which is common at these types of places. I got the medium which was just not spicy at ALL. If this was mild I wouldn't have blinked an eye. I could forgive that but not the lack of seasoning. It seemed like they just boiled the seafood in plain unseasoned water, which was confirmed by a FB reviewer that spoke to manager who told him that's exactly what they did.  It didn't seem like the sauce was even cooked with or tossed properly in the sauce at all. It was just like...boiled tasteless seafood resting on top of bland sauce. So so disappointing! 

Also minor pet peeves, had to ask like 4 times for some melted butter for my wife and kids to dip their crab in and only got it when they were 2/3 through meal. Didn't clear out our shell buckets when obviously full and we were still eating. Also the bags they used are very deep, much more so than any other crab boil place been too which made getting to the food very awkward. Again minor but just..weird. 

Just so you don't think this is a total hit job, the location is nice and the staff (other than douchey manager) were very friendly. And my wife and kids who just got  plain steamed seafood enjoyed (although did say lack of salt, but the seafood itself was cooked well at least to temp and texture if not flavor). 

So maybe if you just enjoy very plain, low to no seasoned seafood you may like this. But to me the only reason to visit this sort of seafood boil place is for very flavorful Cajun seafood and this was so far away from that. And esp for the price (180 for fam of 2 adults and 2 young kids with tip but without drinks or ability to byo) for such an underwhelming and flavorless meal is borderline criminal. Def please stay away unless Crab Du Jour corporate can somehow get a handle on this location and make some quick changes. Otherwise predict a very quick demise of this restaurant sadly",2.9523076923076923,1.0,negative,13

If the place was called ""Greenhill Pizza,"" they'd get five stars. If they were called ""Greenhill Deli,"" they'd get one star.

I came here on the recommendation with the affirmation that they had the best cheesesteaks in Delaware. Better than Goodfellas? Nooooo way, I said. I was right.

The cheesesteak was one of the more inferior cheesesteaks I had in my life, probably on par with Tony Luke's or Sonny's up in Philly (at least inferior cheesesteaks from a reputable cheesesteak vendor, so gas station cheesesteaks I consumed while I may/may not have been intoxicated don't count). The best way I can describe the actual meat of the cheesesteak is fine-cut dipping tobacco. It was granulated to the point that you wouldn't recognize it as beef if it wasn't placed in the sandwich. Then there was very little cheese (which was probably a good thing because it wasn't good). But my biggest beef (no pun intended) was with the roll. Hey Greenhill, what the @#$%???? The roll was so soft and flavorless. It was the type of roll I'd expect from a homeless shelter on Thanksgiving, not an actual place that sells cheesesteaks for a profit.

So why aren't they getting one star? The pizza, which was amazing. I saw it while I was waiting for my order and it looked really good so I told them to throw in a slice of unheated pepperoni. I am very glad I did. Probably a top 5 slice of pizza. That's what they need to focus on. Forget the subs, allocate all resources to mass producing their pizza. I'll definitely be back for more of it.

Aside from the food, the place is very pleasant. It's located in West Wilmington (the only Wilmington) and has a really cool place to sit outside, which not too many Wilmington food establishments have. The guys were inside were real cool too. Tons of Phillies posters, and the guy was nice enough to give me directions from St. Elizabeth's (most Wilmington places when asked for directions will pull the classic Hangover: ""It's on the corner of get a map and f--k off""). 

Overall, I'm glad I went to Greenhill. Go for a slice, but skip the hoagies. If you've read my other reviews, you'll know your go-to's for sandwiches are Capriotti's, Goodfellas, and Capriotti's.

I like to support local, craft businesses in South Jersey, and that's exactly what Royal Mile is!

My coffee roast preference is light-to-medium and instead of blends, I try to get a new single origin variety each time I'm buying. Royal Mile hits on both accounts.

Their new packaging looks awesome, they still hand write the roast and sell-by dates on each bag. I generally won't buy a bag if a coffee company doesn't provide this information.

As a relatively new coffee drinker (last 2-3 years), I'm figuring out how to discern between flavors, but it's always fun to read the taste notes on each bag - even if my palate isn't good enough to pick up on them.

I started having coffee each morning while I did freelance work for one of the biggest craft coffee companies - La Colombe. Royal Mile has many of the same single origin beans and in my opinion is just as high quality.

So far, my favorite type with a unique taste is Ethiopia Yirgacheffe. This has a noticeably ""juicier"" taste than others. Clearly, I need to work on my descriptions!

And it's local!!  Seriously, it exactly matches my espresso taste for a slightly sweet, dark chocolate with light fruit overtones brew. Works well with medicum milk beveridges like flat whites where the dark chocolate becomes milk chocolate.

My only reservation about the coffee is their distribution. Event though the roaster is a mile from my house, I can only find it reliably at the local Cherry Hills Whole Foods where the coffee has often sat a month or longer in its CO2 venting bags. For espresso, I like my coffee no older than 2 weeks out of the roaster.

Royal Mile also has a decent decaf that works well with their espresso if you want half-caf espresso.",3.991875,4.0,positive,16

I will agree with M W.'s review that the delivery drivers are always friendly, even when they have to make a second trip to your house....Here's where my tirade begins. Today is my last time ever ordering from not only the Upland Square Pizza Hut, but all of the Pizza Hut chains everywhere. The past five, yes, five times I have ordered from this establishment there have either been incorrectly prepared items or items that I paid for omitted from the order. Then when you call to tell them about it, the EVER so HELPFUL management (Note the sarcasm) decides the best course of action would probably be a store credit. This way you are now stuck having to order from them again, and more than likely, deal with some more ineptitude. Or, your other option, to have them redeliver the missing or correct items, you get to wait about an hour and a half for you to be important again because the new orders are more important than making your order right. They already got your money at this point, so why should they really care? So much for family dinner on time, folks. So, in closing, hopefully this review will be helpful for those looking for a decent pizza. If it is, then you know not to order from here. Ever.",1.4323076923076923,1.0,negative,13

It's the type of food spot that you crave again the next day, and the next.

We found this spot while running errands in the area, and visiting another food truck nearby. It is very easy to drive past, so you need to slow down early and really look out when it's your first time trying to locate it. The truck is on a busy highway, but on your right there's a small parking lot, then building with shops, and directly following that is the entrance to the lot for Arepas donde Flor. Roughly 3-4 cars can fit.

Her food is made to order, from scratch, so be patient with the wait -- or order ahead online. Although I will say, everything I've gotten here has been absolutely worth the wait. I mean, after running errands in the area I tried to come back for seconds but they were closed.

My family used to order from here every single Friday when I was growing up...for many years. I got really sick of it. Cocco's Agggaaaiiinnnn??!

Their pizza has a thick crust, more cheese than sauce, and decent flavor. It always seemed to be really quick. We ordered and usually picked it up from a few blocks away...always ready quickly.

Now that I live away from the land of cheesesteaks, I more often order a cheesesteak from here rather than pizza. They use Amoroso rolls, as all good cheesesteaks do. I get mine with cheese whiz....yummm. A very respectable cheesesteak. Wish I had one right now!",3.3786666666666667,3.17,neutral,15

I ordered a pepperoni and mozzerella stromboli, and when it showed up, the box said Cocco's Pizza.
The stromboli was big, yet completely flat, like a grilled cheese.  In spite of looking weird, it tasted good.  No sauce (inside or on the side), but still not bad.  I ate it and thought it was a good decision.
At 3:00AM, I woke up with the worst stomach pain I've ever had.  I spent the next 8 hours in the bathroom, sicker than I've ever been from food poisoning from this stromboli.

There are several parking spots on their lot and I didn't have a problem parking either time.  

On the first visit I tried their Old Fashioned Hoagie - Sharp provolone, prosciutto, capicola, pepper ham, salami with hot peppers.  With those kind of ingredients I was expecting a great experience, but sadly the sandwich was underwhelming.  There was an off taste with the meats and the sharp provolone was very weak.  The roll was decent.  The lady who took my order gave me the ""everything's good here"" line so I went with what looked good on the menu.  

On my second visit I had a much better experience.  The guy who took my order recommended their burger and gave me a little history of Cocco's, as there are several in this area of DELCO.  There are a couple locations that are run by the original owner and this location was the first, opening in 1978.  The location in Primos PA, not too far away has a gelataria attached.  The other locations are ""franchises"" that buy freshly made rolls, dough and cheese from the owner.
  
The 8oz never frozen burger came on a fresh, daily made roll.  I had him throw on cheese and hot peppers with a small order of crinkle cut fries and in 10 minutes I had my lunch.  With a bottle of water I was a little over $10.  The bun was fresh and delicious, the meat itself could have been seasoned a bit more, but the hot peppers helped perk it up a bit.  It was big burger and the cheese he used was excellent and really helped bring the sandwich together.  

Overall I think the people running this location are very nice and have a good offering for a great price.  Give them a try if your in the area.",3.3786666666666667,3.12,neutral,15

I walk in and in all honesty, it was 10:30ish 11am and it was nothing but my grandmas age customers eating. I felt so weirded out. Idk why, I'm just saying i did. Anyways, it's super small inside with less than 20 tables.  Two hostess.  Both busy and well,  not very umm, customer care oriented.  I took the last table thankfully because right after, people were coming in droves to dine in.  I ordered the Philly chicken omelette what came with peppers, Onions, mozzarella and mushrooms, grits and an English muffin. The omelette was huge, warm, and cheese was melted to a stringy magical string when cut into. Yumm right.

My date  had a meat omelette with home fries and wheat toast. He devoured the whole thing too. 
We paid our tab and left.

My parents use to go to Victor's once a week if not more. I've been a very small handful of times. The place is LITERALLY a hole in the wall. Everything is dated, parking and seating are limited, and the menu selection is basic. Victor is the chef and its basically like eating at Victor's house. It's home cooked food that is the mom and pop comfort food. I hear that there are few meals that are Victor's specialty and are 5 stars. 

Now, the reasoning I allow the 5 stars, aside from my parents insisting, is that my parents had fallen on hard times and this place was in their budget. Even aside from the extremely low prices, the staff became family to them. Their favorite waitress sobbed when they moved and sobs every time they come down to visit. It's literally no question that they HAVE to eat there when they are down so this Labor Day weekend I had their Veggie Omelet with home fries. My mom will try and tell you that you will never find a better cooked batch of home fries. Sorry, no pic as my meal was delivered to me after they ate their meals at the restaurant visiting their favorite staff. 

So if you are on a budget, want a home cooked meal, or just want a cozy place to enjoy a coffee and read the newspaper.... this place comes highly recommended by my parents.",3.9741176470588235,3.59,neutral,17

The parking and access are very easy; the shopping center has a Fry's store and other sundry services.

During the summer, it's staffed all by children. By children, I mean to say high school or early college students who really don't have well developed organizational or customer service skills. I have never seen any real adults around in keeping the act together. I've witnessed long summer lines and many workers in the back, However, the line drags on and on with screaming toddlers. Where are the franchisees? Don't they want to maximize the time of their hourly employees, and make their customers happy?

Nobody behind the counter is particularly friendly or knows how to smile.

The men's rooms is consistently dirty, and looks like some components need repair. This should never, ever be the case in a restaurant.

These burritos are the size of your forearm! They have a pretty good portion of meat along with the rice inside a very large flour tortilla. I truly enjoyed the chorizo burritos.

They have a nice selection of sauces that you can fill your to go cups with, and a large warming tray they always keep full with freshly fried tortilla chips. Fill a bag with tortilla chips while you are waiting for your burrito to be made, fill your little cups with different salsas, and you are all set when your burrito is finished being built.

They have a menu board over their salsa bar, but I have not tried any of those items. Perhaps in the future I will, when I tire of these gigantic delicious burritos! They cost about seven bucks apiece after-tax. Not bad for a large lunch!

She did offer to replace my cone with a different vanilla yogurt product (why do they have two?) which was better, but added to the overall slow and unpleasant experience.  The ice cream here isn't stellar either - maybe on par with Coldstone Creamery (not a fan of that either), but no where near the quality of Woodside Farms or Caffe Gelato, or a gallon from the grocery store for that matter.

Go early for the best selection.  In fact, I see bags after bags of loaves by the door.  Maybe they are for nearby restaurants?",3.686,2.84,neutral,15

The prices are even Miami-cheap, a rarity for what's usually considered ""ethnic"" and therefore specialty-priced elsewhere. 99 cents for a 6 oz colada of espresso? You can't beat that anywhere.

I usually have a big bowl of black bean soup and a side salad, and their yellow rice and garlic bread are other worthy vegetarian selections. (There's a black bean burger, too, but I avoid corn, and black bean burgers usually contain corn.)

Today's special was the picadillo bowl, which was a serving of picadillo (ground beef sautéed with green olives) on top of black beans on top of yellow rice, all heaped up in the center of a plate the size of a hubcap. For under $6, I probably couldn't have made it better or cheaper in my own kitchen.

Service was friendly and unobtrusive; even during the lunch rush we never felt a bit of pressure to give up our table.",3.7835714285714284,4.4,positive,14

If you go on a Friday night you can be treated to all you can eat fried fish and the best karaoke night I've ever seen.  It is amazing.  Drink a Corona and enjoy the free show.

As soon as you sit down you get almost an entire loaf of freshly toasted and buttered Cuban bread which my husband likes to eat all of.  They bring as much as you want which is nice for those that love their bread.

Our family has ordered and really enjoyed the picadillo, chicken and yellow rice, spanish bean soup, and pressed cubans.

They have a special you can order anytime for $5.29 that includes a cuban and a cup of whatever soup your little Cuban heart desires.

Their food is cuban to the core and simply delicious. Here's the list of highlights you need to know.

-  We've ordered the Picadillo, Palamillo Steak, Palamillo Steak Sandwich on Cuban toast, BLT on Cuban toast, Black bean soup, Garbanzo bean soup, yellow rice, flan, Flaco's Breakfast Special (3.99 for coffee, two eggs, grits or hashbrowns, bacon or sausage and toast). We enjoyed every last bite of them, just not all in the same visit.

- Consistently good food and fresh, made daily from scratch desserts like flan, guava cheesecake, NY cheescake and tres leche cake.

- Delicious coffee! Cafe con leche worth waking up early on a Saturday morning.

- Inexpensive, dinner for two with coffee and dessert is usually about #30 - $35 with tip.

- The restaurant itself may seem a little outdated and, for me, the cigar boxes on the wall-paper boarder topped walls are a bit kitschy but the staff is super nice and helpful with menu questions. Bathrooms are clean too.

- K.A.R.A.O.K.E. It is amazing. Zephyrhills is full of 15 thousand elderly patrons and a few hundred young families. Friday nights will be a little hard on the ears but will not disappoint.",3.7835714285714284,3.14,neutral,14

I was introduced by my girlfriend who grew up in Williamstown. From what I know, Palermo's has been around for a bit now. They certainly pre-date Pat's and may just be one of the town's best kept secrets sitting quietly in a plaza along the Black Horse Pike (Rt 322) whose main business from the street appears to be a CVS. 

Now, I've had a lot of South Jersey pizza and most of it, albeit good, tastes the same to me, but something about Palermo's pizza is different. It's better and still maintain's the old school neighborhood pizza vibe that so many other's of it's kind have lost. It doesn't try to be anything it's not (in fact, its Internet presence is practically limited to Yelp) but it will continue to serve hungry people from the neighborhood when they are craving that perfect slice. 

The crust is thin but not paper or cracker thin, yet has the right amount of depth to support the sweet tomato sauce and gooey cheese. Pizza is something that should absolutely be cherished here but there is another hidden star that, although on the menu, must be ordered a specific way. 

This item - is the fried pizza turnover. Some of you may be shaking your head thinking, but isn't that just a panzerotti and you know what, you would be correct. But because Palermo's does their own version, they cannot call it that. What makes a Palermo's panzerotti so special? Well for one thing, you better be hungry when you order. This turnover is the size of a baby, and I'm not joking. I've never seen a panzerotti this big. Size does matter here. It's large and in charge and will keep you coming back for bite after bite. Yes, it needs to be cut up and eaten, preferably with at least one partner, as this behemoth is not for the faint of heart. 

By now, you should get the point. Neighborhood pizza joint with a small sign, tucked deep back into a small unassuming plaza churning out delicious pies and fantastic 'fried pizza turnovers.' Come hungry. Leave Happy.",3.664,3.88,neutral,15

However, when I talk to the old heads, they go even further back to the 1960's in St Louis (and again that all depends on where you lived). So while the industry itself is not new to Saint Louis, my food experience with Street life is.

When the Street Life truck pulled up at my location, I decided to do something I never do: try an oyster po'boy sandwich other than my mother's. ) It's just something I never would do, until now and wow the oysters were fried to a caramel brown perfection. The roll was fresh and nicely toasted. The pickles onions and aioli sauce complemented the fried oysters extremely well.  Fries were hot and crispy. The staff was  courteous and nice.

Next we tried the quiche. The crust was out-of-control good, flaky, delicious. It was pretty heavy, it would be plenty for two people. 

Last, but certainty not least, the chocolate brioche buns. All I can say is, ""order this right now if available"". My wife and I just stared at each other in total shock over the deliciousness we were both experiencing. No words were needed.

The St. Albert Fatburger is a combination store which serve burgers as well as Buffalo Express wings and Marble Slab ice cream.  

First impression is great, it is new, it is clean and the menu is 3X the size of a normal Fatburgers.  The TVs on the walls were all tuned to sports of some sort, definitely enough to keep most people entertained during the wait.

I was greeted by the cashier immediately, service was prompt.  I had a tough time deciding between wings or burger but eventually settled on the large cheese burger with fries and drink.  Burgers come in 5 sizes now: small, medium, large, XL and XXL.  I ordered the large (thinking middle of the row should be safe); then I reviewed for food value chart, small = 400-600 cal, medium = 590-790 cal, large = 850-1050 cal, XL = 1350-1550 cal, and XXL = 1850-2050 cal.  Plus fries and icetea, OH MY, that was a lot of calories I consumed at lunch; lol.  

I took a picture of the wings and burger menus, have a look at the choices yourself.

The food came quickly.  The burger was a little on the crispy side.  Very well done, charred on one side (new location = inexperience chefs?).  Oh well, can't expect a perfect burger every time.  With a ton of lettuce and tomatoes on top, it was an okay burger.  The fries was great, fresh, hot and not over-salted like some other locations.  The meal was satisfying, although I do question whether it is worth $14 plus tax plus tips (a $18 fast food meal).  

Besides my stomach for eating too many fries, one thing did bother me a little, if you pay with a credit card, the ""No Tip"" option does not exist on the machine.  My personal dilemma has always been, if I tip at Fatburger, why don't I tip at McDonalds or Starbucks?  The staffs at these stores don't really do anything different.  May be I wouldn't be bothered if the staffs were friendly and cheerful, they really didnt look like they want to be there working today.

Fatburger is a good place to grab a burger; but, there is nothing special about their burgers.  Taste wise, Fatburger's burgers still trail behind Jack Burger Shack's burgers and Five Guys' burgers; price wise Fatburger is pricier.  Would I return, yeah, still need to try those wings but probably won't return for the burgers!

I took my family here for a lunch on our way home. So, after unbuckling 2 very young children, we make our way in and try to place an order. The attending cashier looked at us, for quite a few seconds without saying a word, almost dumbfounded. Then, after taking a partial order, and not answering a question my wife had, stopped talking and just left to talk to another employee. This carried on for over a minute with us standing there. So, he just leaves, and we are left at the cash with nobody. Then,  somebody comes over and tries to take an order, again we repeat our daughters order, then she stares at us, and leaves. Rather irritated at this point, but still willing to try, we ""AHEM"" and she shows back up. My wife asks for my daughters kids meal, which she tries to charge us twice for, then, after we tell her to correct it, she offers us a soda fountain cup, after 3 times telling her that we wanted milk with her meal. She then proceeds to tell us she has to charge us extra for milk, even though it says right on the menu that milk can come with a kids meal. At this point, my arms are tired from holding a car seat, so I tell my wife that I am done trying to deal with these people, I would rather spend more money and at least have servers who are even a little bit dedicated to there job, and not what is going on in there social lives.

Only concern--which the owner, Ken, addressed--is that the portions were too big. Evidently ramen doesn't fare well as a leftover and so the restaurant has not yet figured out a take-out approach. As to the portion size, Ken says, ""Just tell 'em you want a half-portion."" Oh. Good idea!

I hope that they reduce the salt a bit in the vegan bowl. Then I can give 5 stars!

Sufficed to say I must have missed the memo that said this would be a non-traditional ramen, because the selection definitely was geared toward a crowd that has no idea what ramen is. The people that actually do go out of their way to find this ramen shop will be disappointed as this shop would buck the trend of typical shop and just throw caution to the wind in throwing elements together. Case in point to purists: the Ken noodles, even though it is the only item at the time with a pork broth, will not be tonkotsu style as the soup will lack any light cloudiness and instead be a dark bubble of flavor (maybe from lack of cleaning the pork bones I assume, if they even use bones). I don't remember if there was a tare used before my broth mixture was infused into the bowl. Next time I will try the shoyu choice and see how that recipe deviates from norms. 

In terms of service, I was there within the first week so this observation was from then. The service was lacking as there was only one server in the early-bird rush on a Wednesday, and did not know when there were patrons at the noodle bar seated; some waited twenty minutes at the bar. The owner was too focused on customer engagement to even realize other patrons at the bar weren't even given a menu let alone served or taken of their orders. Also basic service in the form of napkins or cutlery were sometimes not even presented even after the noodle bowl arrived.  Also in terms of aesthetics, they could probably go a little more stylish than the Walmart-looking bowls that these things were served in. Your charging at least $14 for these things they should at least have good playing geez. 

Anyways, first week shakedown review. I hope my next time they will have ironed out the kinks.",2.6714285714285713,2.76,neutral,14

I am so unbelievably frustrated at how miserable of an experience I just had here. I've been going to Poke Cafe for a while now, I loved their food and the owner was always so friendly. I've hyped up Naughty Noodle to friends and coworkers and stopped in to Poke Cafe multiple times in the week it was supposed to open begging to find out when I could finally bring my friends around to have some amazing food. The food was good. The waitress was so kind. We didn't have a single issue the entire time we were there until the end when we found out that the owner is an asshole. At the end of our meal we ask for the check. The waitress tells us she can't split it until after a card has been processed, so we hand her two cards and chat some more. One card gets declined. Fine, no big deal, we hand her a replacement and again, continue on. The owner, sitting at a desk in front of a tablet and Square-style card swipe dongle, starts shouting from behind us about how every time we give him a declined card (as if that's somehow our intention) it costs him money. ""$8 I'VE SPENT ON YOUR DECLINED CARDS."" We can't even tell if he's being serious because until this point, he had spent half the night cracking dry-humor jokes at us. It's not until he says, ""I'm serious, take that card back to daddy,"" that we figure out how far off the handle this man has flown. Which is when my friend asks, ""Is that his card you just threw?"" My back was to the owner and apparently he had gotten so mad about this $8 card charge (which we would have offered to cover because we had such a good time) he legitimately THREW A PATRON'S CREDIT CARD UNDER A TABLE. We spent the next five minutes bickering back and forth about the situation. First of all, you don't do that. In all my years of customer service and hospitality, I've never encountered such outrageous, childish behavior from an adult, and that includes my drunkest patrons I've served. I asked him for the bill and he keeps going. ""I have state-of-the-art equipment."" I ask again. ""My machine is not the problem."" I ask him again and tell him to give me the final bill total so I could pay him in cash, he shouts at me not to yell at him (I hadn't, I'd snapped at him for being a toddler) and finally manages to pull up the bill (which I guess he'd just closed instead of figuring out how to let us pay him??). We paid him in cash (and since I'm certain you're reading this the cash on top of what our bill was had better go to that poor waitress and not into your pocket), handed the waitress the extra cash we'd scrounged up, and left. I hope the couple waiting on their food had a better time than us. I have to assume you saw four young adults, and immediately assumed the worst when two cards were declined. I absolutely encourage you to respond to this and tell me what you think our diabolical end game was for this evening. We were obviously not skipping on the bill. Not a single one of us tried to leave and in fact we repeatedly tried to pay you in multiple forms of payment. I literally held cash in my hands trying to pay you and you categorically refused to let me pay until you were done with your temper tantrum. Was our grand scheme to cost you money on declined cards for...what outcome? How does that benefit us? What would be the point?

What I do know is that the pork belly in my Shoyu was the best I've had. It was so crispy and flavorful. It soaked up the seasoning really well, and I'd probably be inclined just to order that particular pork belly for an entree or appetizer here.

My husband had the Ken-Ken, which kind of tasted like Laksa noodles but not quite. I wasn't a huge fan, maybe if they changed the flavor to be more like Laksa I'd enjoy it.

Pro's:

- Outdoor dining which is COVID friendly.

- Staff were very nice and pleasant.

- The outdoor dining area has games and enough space to enjoy the Florida Lifestyle.

- Food was good enough.


Con's:

- Only able to order through the Mr.Beast App or the website using the QR Code.

- Cups were not in stock yet even though being advertised on the splash page on the website that you have to order through. I understand this isn't their fault as the cups have not been sent to them yet but still a con.

- Food takes a while to be made.

- None of the food was very unique or stand out amongst other burger places.

- Only bottle beverages being sold.


Our Order:

- Chandler Style Burger: Two smashed crispy beef patties with house seasoning, served plain with American cheese on a bun.

- Beast Style Burger: Smashed crispy beef patties with house seasoning, sharp American cheese, pickles, diced white onion, mayo, ketchup, and brown mustard on a soft roll

Hopefully none of this comes off as arrogant or condescending. I guess this part may sound a big egotistical, but as someone who is a chef by trade and am also an instructor, I feel like I have to be harsh on this to help the owners of this establishment work through their flaws and reinforce their techniques to better themselves throughout their time. 

Okay so, I live literally seconds from this place and placed my order on the app. I don't really see a problem with this as it is sort of the way of the future as well as this is their concept so, I fully understand it. Plus, it takes me 30 sexonds to get to the establishment door. I was here yesterday for a few burgers that I shared amongst my partner and my roommate. We had the regular smash burger, the special avocado burger and also the specialty fries with the pickles and condiments as well as some seasoned fries. Well, I figured I would be waiting for a bit as I waited 5 minutes to walk over to the establishment. I of course figured I would be waiting a bit longer as well seeing as these guy's are not magicians and do not expect them to have food ready in such short time. (People tend to forget that a great establishment makes your burger as it is ordered and isn't a fast food chain which holds it under heat lamps for over an hour.) Well, I wait about another 10 minutes for my food. Yes. The workers and I'm sure owners of the establishment were very nice, had a great smile on their faces and were very helpful. So, kudos for that part. I finally receive my order and get home within a few seconds, literally....I take out my burger and that of my roommate and partner. We take them out and low and behold they are luke warm at best. The seasoned fries are soggy and semi cold. Nothing was seasoned in terms of salt. Now, I'm okay with seasoned fries just being fries that are tossed in a spice when cooked but, it seems as if they just added the fries into the box and seasoned the top layer of the cold, soggy fries. The buns on the burgers seemed quite old, and was a bit hard and dry. Seeing as this establishment is merely days old, I couldn't come to realize why this was such. I get that a kaiser roll can be a big more dry, but this was almost stale by comparison. I understand they probably practiced cooking their menu products at least for a few days before soft opening, but I wouldn't think their batch of buns would be at such state so quickly. The hamburger patties were what they were, cooked decently, but very bland. They may have added a minimal amount of salt and pepper but it was not very noticeable. I think at the end of the day, I think was mostly disappointed with the fact that I waited about 10 minutes to eat food that was rather Luke warm at best. Now, I will give this place a shot again once they have established themselves a bit better. Usually this take about a month or so to do. But, hopefully they don't turn away hungry customers whom have heard of this place online through YouTube, Facebook, etc.... by constantly selling food that is mediocre at best. 

I will not speak of price points as it is within the average market of what places like these tend to be. And well, we are in a wealthier side of town, so I would suspect no one has any actual issues paying the price point. (Nearly 40 dollars for 3 burgers and 3 fries is a bit steep though) okay. I lied. I spoke of it a little. But, I promise don't change the prices. Just become better quality. 

What they have done with the establishment is very nice and quaint, so I think they did a great job of that. Hence 2 stars versus just one. But, at this point, I will stick to going to 5 guy's where I get a burger that is twice as good and a bit cheaper in the sense of quality. Again. I will be back for sure to give them a chance to get their feet more planted and established. But as for now, I will keep this at 2 stars. I hope the owners read this and can try to take corrective action to make their burgers what they make it out to be. 
 
My burger was the avocado specialty burger. This was a big miss. The avocado was fine but wasn't seasoned whatsoever and very sloppy on how it was placed. I basically paid an extra 2 dollars for what I could have paid 10 cents for. 

Last thing, maybe label the burgers a bit better. It was a little difficult to figure out which was which. For someone who has never been to one of these before. I don't know how your labeling and boxing works. So, it is best to mark them in some way.",2.5347058823529416,2.0,negative,17

The same cannot be said for dining in, where although there are 6 tables, the space is unattractive, poorly maintained, and without effective air conditioning on a hot summer day.  

The Wonton Soup I ordered with my lunch special was the same as in so many other houses of this ilk.  Chicken consume out of a can with thick skinned Wontons and some sort of meat-food within.  The Sesame Chicken was pretty average, but there was plenty for lunch.  The sauce while gloopy, still had the expected sweet taste that is used on almost all similar dishes.  The Fried Rice was made en mass in the morning (or the day before), and was dark from the beef stock it had absorbed, although it had a fair amount of veggies and pork chunks. 

For me it was what I expected - unimaginative and strictly by the numbers cooking.  If you like this style then no harm coming here.  However, if you prefer something more authentically Chinese, one of the best places in Mercer County is right up Nottingham Way at Szechuan House.

One of the best parts about the tea shop is that there are samples available of each tea in containers.  This is helpful for smelling and examiming the teas.

I've been on tea kicks here and there in my life (last time before most recently was during a trip to Michigan where I found a small store with great teas) but most haven't stuck. 

So when I got back home from traveling overseas I kept drinking tea and bought boxes from local grocery stores until I remembered the store in Michigan which made me want to drink more handmade, high quality teas. 

This led me to Yelp which lead me to Traveling Tea. When I walked in I at first didn't see the whole selection (I wasn't being that observant lol) but once I took the whole store in I noticed that they do have a big selection. The selection was overwhelming in a good way. It was basically a ""there are so many good things to choose from which makes it more difficult but I know I'll really love what I buy and enjoy it"" type overwhelming. The good type of overwhelming as said above. 

I ended up buying the Cacao Chai Tea and have to say that it has excellent flavor. Very smooth with definite hints of cacao. Ultimately I was hoping for something with a higher caffeine content but I would still rate this a fantastic tea due to the flavor. I will say that my tea palette is still being refined but I'd rate that tea a 8 or 8.5/10. If the caffeine content were higher the rating would be higher as well. YMMV based on how caffeinated you like your teas. 

I also bought a one serving tea from their high caffeine shelf and can't wait to try that. It was the Guayusa Ginger Citrus. Citrus + heavy caffeine sounds wonderful. Can't wait to try it.

Great selection, reasonable prices and wonderful staff and owner. Nick, the owner, hosts at least 2 customer appreciation parties a year. He usually advertises them early on. During these parties there are raffles in which all of the whacky marketing objects he receives from Beer producers are given away. There's usually something extra, such as Phillies or Sixers tickets. Also, the beer is free but is usually limited to whatever marketing representative offers to come that time. At the last even Nick played drinking games with us and even brought out some of his own beer when the free stuff ran out. Nice guy.

There's also a members card in which you earn 1 point for every dollar spent. These points can eventually be redeemed for $10 off or other prizes. Quite nice.",3.792666666666667,5.0,positive,15

Located way down on Umbria, this spot is pretty much out of the way for me so I had always avoided it. That is no longer the case. Great beer variety (and for the most part the cheapest in the neighborhood), an extremely friendly and helpful staff, and a tapped keg on hand for you to quench your thirst, plus they even hooked up a charity event I was just part of with discount beer. 

If the surplus of beers of all kinds isn't enough to make this a cool spot for you, perhaps the owner's customer appreciation days will do it. A couple times a year (with advanced notice) Javies has CADs, wherein booze is offered to help you enjoy the games held there (beer pong/flip cup style festivities). As an added bonus, in the short time leading up to the party, every time you buy beer you get a raffle ticket for a chance to win some of that cool promotional swag the brewers unload on them, then the day of, the drawings are held until there is no gear left. 

They also do a reward program with spending eventually equaling discounts, but I have yet to take advantage of it so I don't know the ins and outs.

Yesterday Mama Nature fluked out a spring-time-in-winter afternoon with 69 degree weather (third warm day in a row), and that meant many of the local spots that try to save money by shutting off their coolers for the season were selling lukewarm suds (Worldwide, Speedy's).

I used to love this place, their selection is phenomenal and their prices are reasonable.  Two recent incidents will make me never shop here again.  I purchased a Southern Tier Super variety pack a month ago only to find out the beer inside was over a year old.  Nick, the owner, was understanding and swapped out the case with a new one for me and everything was fine.  Tonight my wife went and bought a case of Evil Eye Pa.  I opened the case and noticed the packed on date on the six pack holders read February 2013.  I held one of the bottles up to the light and found sediment galore.  I guess the reason they have such a selection is they let the beer sit on the floor for way longer than they should.  Most distributors will offer beer at a discounted rate when it hits a certain age, but not this place.  They'll keep it at full price until it's gone!

It has been quick every time we have been there, but there appears to be a large gap in the quality of servers.  Also, avoid the french fries, they are awful.

It was a rather fun and interesting experience. I liked the little downtown area but is def not Chicago. :) 

We stayed at the Hyatt which was around a ton of the places to eat and the mall was connected to it. Sweet! We decided to try this Buffalo Wings & Rings since it was not a Buffalo Wild Wings. Hate that place. 

Nice place and bar area with lots of TVs all around. We asked for a booth as always and were happy to see we had our own little TV at our table. Pretty cool. Reminds me of a place back here in Chicago. Our waitress was nice and checked on us several times. Anyways we both ordered the pita wraps. I had the chicken and my bf had the Gyros. Both were very good. Somehow though and I don't think it was the food or I hoped not I ended up very sick and we had to leave. 

Good experience there overall EXCEPT for one waitress that had the balls to complain about Gen Con people. I wish I had her name or picture. Stating that ""THEY"" walk into eat and smell and are annoying yadda yadda. First off not all of us ""gamers"" smell. She made us mad so I had to write about it! Yes sadly there are the ones that did/do smell but not everyone. She along with a older couple sitting in a both behind us made it sound like ALL the people were bad that walked into the restaurant. Sorry but if it was not for Gen Con coming along all these YEARS you would probably close because besides all of us in there is was dead.

We had a Groupon so we decided to give this place a try. The first thing we noticed was that the restaurant didn't seem to have an ""identity""..it was part restaurant, part sports bar, serving Latin food but playing American music..dressed up tables and casual one...just interesting!

The table was dirty and it took the waitress some time before she stopped by again and cleaned it.
Our waitress was Cuban..had a tough time talking to us, when we asked her about couple items on the menu the response was either ""I don't know"" or "" that plate is similar to Puerto Rican food""...huh?? What if I am not familiar with Puerto Rican food? Where is that leave me!?? 

She had 3 tables ..the rest of the restaurant was empty aside from few gentlemen by the bar, we ordered shrimp tacos and it took over 40min to get them! Also the items on the menu were overpriced.

So she was a terrible waitress , it took forever to get ONE order of shrimp tacos, couldn't answer any questions about the menu BUT once the tacos made it to the table they were INCREDIBLE! Just enough flavor and a generous portion of shrimp. 

To us, eating out is more than just good food it is also service and atmosphere, and because of that we wouldn't be going back.",2.44875,2.46,neutral,16

Welcome to Casa 21. A large bar and club /restaurant space with a small latio space out front overlooking the parking lot and Hillsborough Ave. 

I tried the picanha which is a meat and sausage sample served with toothpicks and fries. They have a larger Colombian variets and I got the smaller offering with tasty chicken, meat, and sausage bites as well as lots of lemon and a side sauce somewhat like russian dressing. A guy nearby recommended the lobster bisque ($6.95) so I got that too and enjoyed it a lot.

The place is large and is supposed to be hopping at night. I met the owner and he was nice. Accomodating. My waitress was great. It's nice to see people from various backgrounds and countries mixing. I would like to come back when the place is fully in action but dont be shy about coming by for a bite or drink. :) 

They've expanded to offer lunch and have some breaded chicken or steak items with rice or beans for $6.95 as well as other items on the menu. This is a Latin agglomeration type place with pan Hispanic dishes including Cuban, Peruvian, Colombian, and gringo (American) offerings. 

Some landacaping and greenery around the patio and parking lot would be a welcome addition. :)

In Spanish, tango is probounced tan-go. And tengo means to have. No tengo tango.. I don't have tango. :)",2.44875,2.9299999999999997,neutral,16

We met with a group of people, so it was about 10 of us. The service was HORRIBLE. Not only did I have to find the waitress myself, but we waited over 1:30 minutes for our food that came incorrect. I ordered mofongo and got tostones, but was so hungry that I stayed with the wrong dish. I told the waitress that was the wrong dish and she told me I was wrong and that I ordered what she brought me, which I didn't. I also had ordered a beer that I never got and had to remind the server of. If you order water, they automatically give you bottled water, charge you for it and the staff doesn't communicate that to the guest. 
After a few people in the group had left (they had been gone for over 30 min), the rest of us there realized that someone left without paying their tab. The manager insisted that we were responsible for that tab because we were sitting with them, despite the fact that we ALREADY PAID what we consumed. While trying to get in touch with the people who walked out, the manager grabbed my friend's phone, put it in his pocket and was threatening us to call the police. He would dial 911 and leave it on his phone so that it was obvious that he was ready to call. That was his way of intimidating us and making us responsible for something that his server should have been responsible for. As one who works in the service industry, it's the servers responsibility to ensure that her guests pay their check before they leave. But with the inattentiveness of the service at this place, that wasn't the case and they decided to threaten us and point the blame.

However, I'm not impressed with the actual taste of the meat - I find it to be rather uneventful - certainly not a hamburger I'm remembering a few hours later.

Best thing on their menu?  Onion rings for sure... Somehow those are never left over for my hubby :-)

this is a burger joint that makes good burgers.  they are a little pricer i feel then most of the competition which is what lowers them from 5 star to 4 star imo,  Unlike the other reviewers here i never get coupons to eat here.  I live 80 miles from edmonton and only get to edmonton about 10 times a year.

i eat at harveys at least 50% of the time when i do visit though.  The pickles they use are my favorite topping... the best hamburger pickles ive ever had.  Love that they give you the option for banana peppers too.  All the toppings have always been fresh.

i am a huge potine fan and harvey's makes a very good fast food style poutine.

a single burger and a order of poutine will stuff me and im a big eater... so portion size is very fair but you are looking at around 10 dollars so you deserve to be stuffed.

There's guacamole, Sriracha,

There's fried spuds, rings or pickles.

When you try to address your concerns with the staff they laugh or become argumentative- literally don't take their customers concerns seriously.

How did I end up here?

I was working in B-burg and was starving so I wanted to try a local restaurant. The first one I passed (Savory Thyme?) was PACKED with ""ladies who lunch"". It's in a charming historic home. This was the next closest spot. I walked into the ""restaurant entrance"" and didn't see a soul...but it smelled of smoke. Even though there is no smoking on the restaurant side, the bar smoke leaks over and totally ruins the air. I chose to sit on the patio for some fresh air. The patio has round tables with umbrellas, 2x4 wood picnic tables, and a tent at one end for the live music. It is HOT though! Everything sits on blacktop. As I left, I walked through the bar and saw there were 2 other customers. And lots of ash trays. Because Stone's Throw is technically a bar, no one under 21 is allowed. Because Stone's Throw is in Hendrick's County, they've chosen to continue to allow smoking. Because of this, I will probably not be back. This is also probably why the other 2 cafes in the area were PACKED and this one had 3 customers at noon. Hopefully they'll wise up to this. Cigarettes are gross.

There was a band called he Tighty Whities and they were entertaining.  They had a total white guy flavor on rap songs and made me giggle.  I liked the band more when they played the blues music.

A downfall to the live music here is when they have to move from outside to inside due to sound ordinance.  It takes awhile to reset up the instruments inside.

Do not come here for service.  We never got a waitress except for her to take the tip from a previous person from the table.

The wings came out and they were good and everything was fine so far....the food came out, the burger (ordered medium) was BLACK and had black crust all over it like the grill wasn't scraped. I was chewing black ashes. Gross. My wife's hot dog had taco meat on it that was burnt. She had to scrape it off and couldn't eat it.

Tacos are priced at $1.50 a piece. I tried a few each of pollo, barbacoa, and pastor. I think the pollo and pastor are tied for my favorite, but the barbacoa was incredibly tender and good as well. They are served with chopped cilantro and onion, some form of grilled onions and raw cucumber slices.

My veg friend ordered the vegetarian enchilada, other buddy ordered cheese enchiladas, and I ordered the steak burrito.  Vegetarian Enchilada: my friend cuts open and takes a bit... some odd crunch - wow.. they used frozen asian stir fry vegies!  he had taken a bite of a water chestnut!  Also included with the filling were edamame!  And to top it off, it was lukewarm, with barely melted cheese and a bland red sauce.  Cheese enchilada plate: He cuts open, and none of the cheese was even melted... all still shredded and lose.   Sauce topping was hot, but we were beginning to suspect all our food was microwaved, as they totally forgot to put his in.  Steak burrito: carne asada was lean, but just barely warm, and my tortilla was so rubbery I could hardly cut it with a knife.  Another sign of being over nuked.

Unfortunately the salad was a purée of dark red with a runny and flavorless consistency.

Tortillas are supposed to be ""home made"" there. While they were hot and tasted fresh the exact consistency of each one (there was 12 of them at my table) was exact (size and thickness).
This leads me to believe they are store bought. 
Fajitas were flavorless BUT cooked perfectly.

I went on a Wednesday , which I assumed wouldn't be so busy as a weekend. As I assumed, the place had maybe 2 other families seated. So I immediately thought, hey no wait time!
WRONG. It took the server nearly 30 darn minutes to even get us a simple bottled drink. I don't know why I decided to proceed to order , I decided to give it a chance. The waitress proceeded taking our order. I asked her a few questions about an item on the menu. 
The waitress had absolutely no idea what she was talking about. She had to yell across the room to the chef & ask the questions I had asked her. I decided on getting something easy. I ordered some RED chicken enchiladas thinking there's absolutely no way this can be messed up. 
She comes back THIRTY minutes later with our food & to my surprise, she brought me back some GREEN enchiladas.
First of all : The service was TERRIBLE.
Second : The food was just BLAND, no taste to it and it didn't even look appetizing.
I have NEVER encountered such a horrible Mexican restaurant like this. 
I absolutely do not recommend this to anyone at all, especially if you're staying in that hotel next to it expecting this to be a good restaurant to try out while in town.

I ordered the wonton with hot sesame sauce and my buddy got a wonton egg drop soup mix.  Both our meals came with rice and egg rolls.

The egg roll was cold.  HUGE disappointment.  The wonton's themselves are good, but they consider a hot sesame sauce is entirely different than I experience at 99% of chinese restaurants.  It is accompanied with huge globs of peanut butter (huh?) and mounds of sesame seeds while the ""sauce"" is on the bottom.  The sauce wasn't very good to me anyway, but my buddy mixed everything up and said it was passable (former chinese restaurant owner BTW).  After going 0 for 2....I knew I couldn't possibly be disappointed by the General Tso's right? It's always super yummy with a little extra kick to it.  What happened? Very dry and flavorless chicken with not very fresh rice.  There was 0 spiciness factor.  There were visible peppercorns...but not spiciness.

The wonton soup broth is clear and tasty, and the wontons themselves are a decent size

Firstly, I'll admit the name got my attention mainly because the best subs (or hoagies, as some folks in the Northeast call them) I have ever eaten have been in Pennsylvania.  I was truly hoping the meat would be freshly sliced before being placed on the bread.  Much to our delight, it was sliced and weighed right in front of us.  Then the ingredients are piled upon them.  We ordered five subs online and they were promptly prepared and ready on time.  I ordered the Philly cheesesteak sandwich with mayo, mushrooms, provolone, and grilled onions.  They were really good.  Delicious as a matter of fact.  My wife ordered the Italian sub which she also really liked.  The kids ordered a Philly, and a teriyaki.  We were all very pleased with the overall taste of our subs.  Even thought we ordered for takeout, but the time we ate them 15 minutes later, they were still piping hot. IMO, these were much better than the pre-measured, run-of-the-mill, franchise sub sandwiches that are all over the country.  

Bottom line - Really delicious subs that were freshly sliced like a real deli should do it.  Really fresh meat and piping hot.  If we lived closer, we would eat here often.  We will be back when we come to Franklin again.  Bon appétit, y'all.",2.803125,4.18,positive,16

(The latter is another story.) My opinion falls in the middle of these ratings, so don't look for any great revelations here; just the facts of our visit.

PSEC Subs are made fresh. (Good start)
Their ingredients appear to be fresh. (Another plus)
You can get hot-out-of-the-fryer, hand-cut fries -- or the standard, mundane bag of potato chips. (Nice plus on the fries)
Choose from cold subs and hot subs. (Cold are standard fare; while the hot options have some nice variations like Reuben or Artichoke) Caveat: my Reuben was sparse on meat and overloaded with juice from kraut.

Bottom line is that the food (subs) are ok, but they do not really echo the subs I recall from Philly...not far from where I grew up. Granted, PSEC Subs do not claim to be a Philly reincarnation, but rather, ""fresh ingredients and display cooking"" as a franchising concept.

I actually work for an eye dr and it looked like he had pink eye. So he was wiping his face and then touching all the food/drink. I felt sorry for him but I could barely eat and drink my food thinking it may be contaminated. I decided I would probably not go back at that point. However.

I've been here more times than I have fingers and toes and disagree. Service is fine (it has improved over time) and the interior is pleasant, but the food leaves much to be desired. This Lemon Grass location used to be a Jasmine Thai, which had VASTLY superior food. (Anyone remember their pineapple fried rice with raisins? To die for!!)

I've had just about everything on their lunch menu - the dishes I've had are lackluster, ranging from average to plain awful. Their vegetarian green curry is weak - on their menu it's listed as three stars for spiciness but it tastes barely like one star. Both their hot and sour and coconut soups are watery and tasteless. As for appetizers, their satay is scarily dry, but the sauce is okay.

If I ever find myself here, I skip their ""lunch special"" (~$9 for a soup, appetizer, and entree) and ask for a plate of drunken noodles ($9); it's safe and dependable. I specify they be made so spicy that I can't taste them and occasionally they come close.

One star for good service (depends on who serves you, of course), a clean, attractive interior, and another star for the times their drunken noodles have made me sweat. If you want good Thai, you won't find it here, nor anywhere else in King of Prussia - but DO check out the neighboring towns for amazing Thai eats.

Despite other reviews, I happen to think this Lemon Grass location is a good value.  The food is tasty and it's a BYOB.  Yes, the waitress doubles as the living, breathing version of the Evil Jungle Princess, but you can't beat the value coupled with the proximity to the KOP mall.

We shared the Tulip Dumplings and found them a little doughy but good from a flavor standpoint.  My opted for the Vegetarian Lover and had only nice things to say.  I opted for the Green Curry with Chicken.  The menu indicated this was one of the spiciest options (i.e. it received the three peppers, which is the universal symbol for holy shit this is going to be hot). Nay, I say.  This was a one on the pepper scale.  Nonetheless, it tasted great and provided the appropriate serving size.

We swung into Lemon Grass on a Saturday evening around 6 p.m. and it was dead.  We figured it was still early and expected it to fill up by the time we left.  Wrong.  The main dining area seats roughly 60 people and we had the space to our lonesome for most of our meal.  Very bad sign for a Saturday night, but this was the weekend following Thanksgiving.

With such a light turnout, we expected the service to be quick and attentive.  Our app and entrees came out quickly and in decent intervals. Our water glasses never went empty.  Friendliness, on the hand, was not our servers specialty.  No greeting or smile or thank you.  I will say that we've dined here several times and this is the first time this has happened to us.

The lunch special is a steal. For $8.95, you get soup, appetizer, and an entree so it's definitely worth it. 

The service does stink. There is only 1 waitress for the entire restaurant and it always takes forever even if you are the only table there. Just one piece of advice: be ready to order when she comes to you. If you're not ready, she won't be back for at least another 15 minutes.

Things started off weird and never recovered. For one, the sign in the window said 'closed'. We walked in and there were no customers in the entire place. So, naturally, we asked...""are you open?"" The staff acted like we just peed on the floor. Gee, our bad.

We sat and ordered quickly enough. The menu was very similar to other Thai places (like Thai Orchid/Pandan Leaf/whatever its called now in Berwyn...a much better option BTW). You pick an app, a soup, and an entree. I got the Tulip Dumplings to start, and like another reviewer mentioned they were very dough-y and rather bland. Strike one. Next up was the Lemongrass soup, which was thin, bare, and whattaya know, bland. Steee-rike two. Finally it was the Evil Jungle Princess. A common name for a common dish, yet this one was uncommonly boring. Bland, bland, bland. Thai food should be a broad experience, this was nothing. Strike three, looking.

On the plus side you get a lot of food for the money (with the lunch special anyway). Of course, you could pay less, the same, or even more money at a host of other places and not feel like you wasted your time.

After we sat down, there wasn't really much of a greeting but in the end, I really didn't care.

A short list of the things they helped us with:
1. Consulting on space design and set up at our wedding venue
2. Flowers (selection and presentation)
3. Event management (they orchestrated our Friday party...in lieu of a rehearsal dinner..and cooked some delicious side dishes to accompany our BBQ)
4. Day-of wedding coordination

In short, they did it all! They met with us when we needed some help early on visualizing the space and the look we wanted for our wedding. They took care of the flowers, requiring of us just one hour-long trip to the wholesaler to show them what we liked (the flowers were gorgeous, btw, exactly what we had envisioned). They ran to perfection the Friday party for all our out-of-town guests. They also cooked some delicious side dishes to accompany the BBQ we brought in from Memphis (baked beans, mac & cheese, key lime balls and brownies, etc.). Lastly, they made sure that everything went off without a hitch the day of the wedding.  

They were an absolute pleasure to work with! Prompt, professional, and friendly. They always seemed to have everything under control, which made us rest easier leading up to the wedding.

   ---   ---   ---

When I saw the list of restaurants that would be at Sparkman Wharf, the fact that Mise En Place would be opening a concept here, I was pretty excited. I visited the Wharf the first two days it was open in an effort to try as many vendors as possible, but virtually no one was serving food around 11:30a on Day #2. I definitely have to give Montados credit for being just about the only one who was fully open for business at that time.

Most of the items looked pretty appealing here, so I basically just went ahead and ordered all of them! Well, all besides the charcuterie. 

Pan Con Tomate - It was fine. Not exceptional, not bad. It's just bread with tomato, olive oil and sea salt - very similar to the complimentary bread you'd be given at an Italian restaurant. 3-stars.

Tortilla Espanola - Definitely not what I was expecting. It was basically like a giant, rubbery egg with some sauce on top. After one bite, I regretted ordering it. 1-star.

Patatas Bravas - My favorite thing here. A solid rendition of a dish I've had a handful of times. 4-stars.

Tostones - 2nd favorite item, but I've had better tostones in the past. 3.5 stars.

Chocolate Bread - Like the tortilla espanola, one bite and we were done. Even my chocolate loving wife did not enjoy this at all. 1-star.

The bill with these items and 2 bottles of water came to $41 - significantly steeper than the value received, IMO.

Rounding up from 2-stars to 3 because it's the 2nd day the business was open to the public and the fact that they were serving food when the other vendors were not, but I was definitely bummed out by this experience.",2.272307692307692,1.7199999999999998,negative,13

For a typical charcuterie in a nice wine bar it's typically $8-$10 so this was way over priced for what you were getting. We also got the Patatas bravas with brava sauce and piquillo pepper Aoili. I didn't think the sauces were the best compliment and left me craving some old fashioned ketchup or sriracha. Not to mention, you can get potato wedges with better flavor and sauce from KFC. We also got the tostones which are fried plantains topped with pulled pork, avocado, salsa criolla, and aji panca mojo. This was probably the best of the dishes although I prefer the one from ceviche to this one. Again between the sauces and the marinade it left me craving a little more flavor.

To drink we got the Espumoso and Begonia Sangria. Unfortunately the drinks came in a sad plastic cup and seemed like the pours were incredibly small. Drinking wine out of cheap plastic on a park bench with charcuterie on a paper plate just didn't feel right. I don't think they can really recreate the atmosphere of classy wine Bar out of a shipping container while standing in line, with cheap park benches, no service, no music, no candle lighting.

If you want to go to a real dedicated stand alone wine bar, I recommend going to Cooper's hawk by International Mall, Ybor city wine bar, Wine Exchange off Swann in Hyde Park, or Cru Cellars off Macdill in South Tampa.  If you want to go to a real dedicated Tapas restaurant, I recommend going to Fly Bar in downtown Tampa or the Lure off Macdill in South Tampa or Ceviche in Downtown St Pete.",2.272307692307692,1.8499999999999996,negative,13

Competition is a always healthy though, so we definitely wanted to try it out.

Located in Christy's Corner near the movie theatre, Sushi Toshi has taken over the spot next to the Chinese buffet with a large parking lot. Plenty of seating inside and a patio available, though I'm not sure if they'll actually open it up. All the dishes are branded with the restaurant name, and it's bright and open in the main dining room with a window to the kitchen and a sushi bar to the side. Open 4-10 each night, it was $32.95/person for a week night, and that includes 1 meat to grill, unlimited hot food, 30 piece max for sashimi, and unlimited fountain drinks (Pepsi). 

We went with the 8 oz pork belly and the 6 oz steak to grill. You can add more meat for $5. The meats and sauce came out long before the stone, but the rest of the food came out in quick succession. Steak was good, but the pork belly wasn't anything special. You can get unlimited pork belly under the hot food section that's already cooked and was seasoned vs the one for the grill which was plain. Steak is your best option for the grill.

The sashimi was good - tasted fresh and cold and the texture was good. Rolls, nigiri, and handcones were good but plentiful with the rice, so be mindful of that. The hot food was what impressed me most - the miso soup had a lot of flavour and wasn't watered down (if you get the wonton soup, it's 2 wontons in the miso soup and it's delicious), the fried foods were fresh, hot and crispy without being greasy, the short ribs, pork belly and beef wrapped enoki were deliciously seasoned and grilled perfectly. I could eat just those meats and be very happy. 

Side note: we were really full and didn't think we were leaving a lot (we left 2 pieces of vegetable tempura, 1 small piece of maki (of a 4 piece roll), 1 beef enoki and some fried rice) and were told that we had left a lot and they would normally charge us for it. So...be careful how much you order because they may be more strict than other AYCE places.",3.489411764705882,3.47,neutral,17

I tried sushi toshi last weekend after learning that they recently opened up at the old manila bay location and was hopeful but I found almost everything very lacking. 

The salmon sashimi was alright but the tuna sashimi was terrible. The tuna pieces did not taste like tuna and had been frozen and thawed so many times that they disintegrated from being picked up with chopsticks. Additionally both the tuna and ""red snapper"" (looked suspiciously like butter fish) were mushy and seemed off.

Rolls and Maki are okay but despite small portions, the rice to filling ratio was high and there was limited options. Not the greatest selection either. 

Kitchen food items were generally better, though the first order they sent tiny portions in an attempt to get you to over order on the second order where they send out regular portions. Pork belly was mediocre, not tender but crunchy. Mango shrimp has very little taste and no mangos or canned peach. Teriyaki basa and beef, beef ribs and beef tataki were good. 

Hot stone beef steak was the high light of the meal however you are limited to 1 free protein with each additional one $5 on top of 35$ buffet price tag.

Other issues I had were a waitress asking us if we were done our meal when we were waiting for our order & dried wasabi on plates that have been sitting for a day. Wasabi had dried and hardened / changed colour but we were served 2 plates of this during our meal. It was like playdough...",3.489411764705882,2.72,neutral,17

We were warned that if we left too much food you'd be charged & that dishes were 1 piece each item unless otherwise marked (ex rolls are marked as 2 pieces per order). 2h seating max. Pop & vanilla ice cream are included. 

Sashimi (Max 30 pieces per adult) - fresh but small. 

Sushi (rolls, cones, etc) - pretty good, fresh. 

Hot stone (max 1 per adult) - we tried pork belly with ginger sauce, the concept was fun but the pork belly was rubbery/chewy and had no flavour. 

Kitchen - we ordered 10 beef sashimi as it was supposed to be 1 piece per order according to the server, she brought us 10 dishes of beef sashimi with about 5 pieces of sashimi each - while this might not have been the amount we expected it wouldn't have been problematic except that the sauce tasted like heavily peppered vinegar. Our sashimi loving kids wouldn't eat it & frankly we didn't want to either. This was omitted from our bill as we explained that we were told it was 1 piece per order unless otherwise stated on the ordering form. The grilled eggplant & zucchini were good. 

Deep fry - our kids enjoyed the tempura & chicken kaarage (ask for it without spice sprinkled on top if you / the kids don't like spice). 

Overall - the service was good & we REALLY wanted to like this place as it's very close & our current favourite Japanese place is on the opposite end of the city - unfortunately we were underwhelmed with the food we will not be back.",3.489411764705882,1.0,negative,17

I enjoyed our meal and there was plenty to choose from, but it was a hundred bucks for 1 adult, 1 senior, and an 11 year old who ate very little, so not a place we'd frequent frequently.  As my dining partner pointed out, you don't even get to take home leftovers for that price :-).

We went on a Friday night and it was very busy and VERY loud, as the room is small and tables are close by.  Service was prompt and all the food was hot (or cold, as need be) and good.  I appreciated that the fried foods were crispy and not greasy.  It's also nice that the dishes are marked one or two pieces each, so you have less chance of not finishing it and being penalized.  We've been to other places where the serving may be 4 to 6 pieces and if you don't like it/finish it, you essentially end up paying twice for it.  With so much to choose from, it's much better to ""sample"" a small serving and then re-order whatever you liked best.

Be forewarned - it's $$$ at $100 for a senior, adult, and kiddo on a Friday night.

First off, I LOVE that they have a colour menu with pics to correlate with your ordering sheet.  This is phenomenal for newbies to AYCE sushi as well as lucky kiddos.  I also liked that the portions were small!  I greatly dislike it when AYCE sushi joints give you larger portions or 6 rolls to an order.  Another bonus - pop is included here in your AYCE price. 

After reading fellow Yelpers' reviews we stuck to steak for the self grilling portion which my kiddo loved!  The sauces that accompany the meats were fabulous and great to dip with any of the AYCE options.  

Food was quick, hot, and prepared perfectly 99% of the time. 

From poke bowls to tempura to sashimi to seaweed salad, they've got it all!  

I really appreciate that the sides like kimchi and seaweed are small.  You can easily order a second or third but aren't stuck with a big bowl if no one else st your table wants any.  

The tempura was a big hit with my kiddo but at $23 for a strip of steak and a few pieces of tempura, I don't think I'll be bringing her back here anytime soon. She didn't care for the won ton soup here - had an unusual base and I appreciated that we weren't charged for her not liking it - frankly none of us did. 

I'd definitely come back here but I think I'd enjoy it more in a larger group of adults. 

Oh and vanilla ice cream is included here - it's an extra $1 for flavors like green tea or red bean.

We both ordered the steak for the hot stone part and the first thing we noticed that instead of a raw full steak being brought out for us to grill ourselves, the meat was cut into strips and seared on the outside. Not fully cooked, just enough to not be red anymore. After they put it down on the table we asked about the change and the server shrugged and said ""they must be doing something different"" We grilled the meat on the stone and after the first piece we both stopped eating - the meat was bad. Not just bad as in poor quality, the meat was actually rancid. We flagged the server back down to tell him and he sort of laughed and said, ""I thought it wasn't right"" and took it away. He didn't offer us anything new - he went and talked to an older gentleman (maybe a manager? owner?) and when he came back he said we could upgrade our free ice cream to the sesame ice cream for free (that would have cost us $1 each - so they offered us $2 for serving us bad meat). 

We decided to leave and asked for the bill. While waiting, we saw the older man our server talked to, go to the back and then the people in the kitchen started staring/glaring out the window at us. It was all very uncomfortable.

One visit and I'm a fan of the frozen yogurt treats and this bright, sparkling clean location where pride of ownership shines.  

THE DRILL
The very friendly owner was on site to guide a newbie through the 'how to':

1. There are tasting cups to sample any or all of the roughly 14 varieties of yogurt (one dairy free and one sugar free for restricted diets) and sorbet from the self serve machines.

2. Once you have selected your choice (or two or three or...) dispense as much as you want into a generously sized one-size-fits-all container.

3. Proceed to the toppings table to add some or none of the several there as you choose...from gummy worms to M&Ms to granola to...

4. Proceed to the syrups station to add some or none of the peanut butter, caramel, chocolate ""shell"" or warm chocolate fudge as you choose.

5. Proceed to the check out where your container is weighed (you pay by the ounce) and grab a plastic spoon and you're good to go. 

GOOD FLAVORS
I lean to being a frozen dessert purist so passed up the toppings but succumbed to a little of the warm fudge syrup on my Toasted Marshmallow frozen yogurt.  It was darned yummy.  I highly recommend the Tart Black Cherry and Vanilla yogurts too.  Great flavors, just sweet enough and not too much so.  Next time I'll have Salted Caramel on my agenda.  And the time after that Pineapple Sorbet paired with Coconut Yogurt.  And then...well...I can see several trips in the door to try all the flavors.

AFFORDABLE OR EXPENSIVE - YOU GET TO DECIDE
Prices could quickly escalate here if one added a lot of toppings to add ounces.  Fortunately for my wallet, and my waistline I hope, I'm on a diet and the just enough but not too much serving size I selected was only a couple of bucks.  The point being, very affordable treat for calories and cash if you know when to say when.

THIS N THAT:

1) PARKING:  Already tight in the lot shared by Starbuck's, a dry cleaners and several other businesses.

2) ACCESSIBILITY:  Level in the door and throughout.  Seating is standard height.  Assistance would be needed by someone unable to stand to reach the levers of the yogurt machines and topping container, all of which are outside of reach range.

3) HOURS:  Currently noon - 10p seven days a week, although subject to change.

4) COFFEE:  Coffee and frozen yogurt go so well together and the owner was very nice to let us bring in our Starbucks cups to sip coffee while we enjoyed our yogurt.",2.585384615384615,3.18,neutral,13

The yogurt at this place is super, and its location is convenient for us.  We've been Menchie's fans for a few years.  Scoring the yogurt alone I'd give 4 or 5 stars.  It's really good stuff.

But 3 out of 3 visits we've had a bad experience with the owners/staff!  Take yesterday's visit:

When the 5 of us walk in there is only one table occupied and we are the only others in the place.  The gal behind the counter is watching us enter, seemingly sizing us up. She says not a word, but watches our every move like a hawk.  The sample tray has 8 cups on it; doing the math that means we each get one sample; three of us get another.

Everyone grabs an sample cup, and the first words she speaks are 'I would ask that you don't use sample cups twice.'  I'm immediately thinking my teens are guilty, but there's no time even to have sampled the first flavor.

By the time I'm interested in another sample, the tray is empty, and I ask for another sample cup.  Without saying a word, and with a face like I'm a criminal, she reluctantly sets out 4 more cups.

As we began getting our actual cups, she tells us the waffle cones are no additional charge.  How generous! Errr, wait.  The waffle cone will be weighed with the rest of the contents of the cup . . .  Technically, it costs no more than anything else you put in your cup, but it _is_ more stuff in your cup.  On second thought, the carefully-worded 'offer' seems calculated to deceive and to pad the bottom line.

While we are filling our cups, an older gentleman walks in and walks towards the soft serve area while talking on his cell phone.  I thought he was another customer, being that he walks right over to where we are and stands beside me while carrying on what sounds like a business conversation.  I become aware that he's standing very close to me, and when I turn towards him to assess what's going on, he motions to me that I need to move so he can get behind the counter.  Caught off guard, I quickly move out of the way and he walks behind the counter and up to the register, clearly the owner or manager or something.  Realizing what just happened I am amazed that he couldn't be bothered to greet his customers, ask politely that I move (or better still, wait patiently until I do), or thank me once I do move.  No 'excuse me', no 'pardon me sir', no nothing.  I was nothing more to him than a guy standing in his way.

The unfriendly woman rings us up and I fork over the more than $25 for the 5 cups, feeling like a complete sucker.

I could go on about the other visits, but it's essentially more of the same.  Each time I've felt like I'm less of a wanted customer and more of a wanted criminal.

From now on, I'll make drive down Eagle road to the other Menchie's.",2.585384615384615,1.0,negative,13

She yelled out across the store at our friends kid for touching the window one time. She was cold, unfriendly, and made us feel uncomfortable. The waffle cone for ""no additional charge"" is misleading too. Yes they are not charging separately for the waffle cone, but they are adding it to the weight of the bowl so you are paying extra for adding the waffle cone. The waffle cone should be marketed as an optional topping, or addition, but definitely not as ""no additional charge"". 

Bottom line is this, the yogurt is good, but so is Aspen Leaf. At least at Aspen leaf (which is very close to this location) we are not treated like unwelcome guests. I much prefer the experience at Aspen Leaf over the way we have been treated at Menchies.

We are very happy with the yogurt and the location. We love to take our daughter next door to play games and then get a yogurt on the way home. The reason for the poor rating is because we are quite irritated with the owner. For some reason, she is very hesitant to give out bags for our yogurts to take home. On our first visit, we had three yogurts and asked for lids and bags. It turns out, that because of the shapes of the lids, only two yogurts can fit in a bag. So, the owner tried to give us just one bag with two yogurts on the bottom and then one your balancing on the top of the two round lids. This doesn't work as your yogurt topples over. We finally got two bags and went on our way. Since then, we have been in about a dozen times and every single time she tries to do the same thing and pretends like it's the first time she has realized that only two fit in the bag. On this last visit, I had to ask for a bag three times before getting one (this time we only ordered two yogurts). I can understand that she is having a hard time making a profit, but what she doesn't understand is that she is driving customers away with the poor customer service.

I seek them out wherever I go and usually hit them up several times a week. I think the yogurt has a lovely creamy texture, the flavors are authentic, and they've always got a good variety of kinds. They also offer lots of topping options if you're into that and the fruit toppings are quite fresh.
This location is bright and was incredibly clean. The only thing that felt weird was that the employee stared at me the whole time I was deciding on my yogurt flavor. I didn't sample, because I think it's rude, so it's not like I was trying a bunch of flavors like some people do. However, the whole time I looked around I felt like I was under the microscope and it seemed a little weird.
The other feedback I have is that some locations offer low-carb yogurt and it's so good. You can eat twice as much as regular yogurt and not feel bad--so it's a win for the store because you buy twice as much and a win for you because you get to indulge. They don't have the low-carb here and they have so many yogurt machines it seems like just having one machine for it wouldn't hurt anyone and would give them variety.
Overall this is a nice place. I hope the fact it's hidden way back in a strip mall doesn't spell death for them, or the fact they opened right next to another froyo place, which seems like a terrible business plan.

Though their menu (http://www.steaknpizza.com/#!untitled/zoom/c21r/image1vf5, get ready to hit ""mute"") claims 5 stars, I'm giving them a charitable two. 

Decent food if you can get it, BUT if you want to dine in somewhere, even somewhere divey, I'd look for a spot that serves beer, closes later, and offers better ambiance (S&P is about as quaint as a hospital food court). Both dining in and carryout take even longer than similar minimum-overhead, maximum-options type places (like Haji's, across the street), so once you finish counting the typos on the menu it starts to get boring in there.

Delivery has been an utter disaster both the times I've tried it. Food never showed up either time. Once they were closed by the time I called to check on it. The other time I gave up and canceled the order myself. I got an apology and a promise of a free pizza, but when I tried to cash that in the next night the guy was just mad at me for canceling the night before and couldn't believe I ""want a free pizza now after you cost me money last night.""",3.1766666666666667,2.0,negative,15

I can't speak for everything on the menu, as I've never had the steak OR the pizza here, ironically. But they bring me greek food. And it's solid, y'all. The cucumber/tzatziki sauce is delicious. Idk if it's authentic, I'm not that fancy, but I know it isn't the ranch dressing that another place in town tries to sell me. The french fries are thin and salty and delicious and what McDonald's fries would be were they real food.

Idk who's watching the store, but I think that's hilarious and awesome and I dig this place.

The ingredients were very fresh and the bread as well but it just didn't all mesh well together.  First they don't have salads as an option at all.  But as I said I am a fan of salads on my bread so I ordered the California Cobb.  It had Bleu Cheese spread on top side of the bread and Avocado spread on the bottom side, Turkey and lettuce, tomato and bacon and that was it.  I don't know what else I was really expecting maybe some egg or I don't know but it was pretty blah tasting.  Maybe the spreads weren't thick enough or something.  

The only soup that they had was chili and I am not a big fan of that either.  I just thought for the middle of January that they would have more than one option.  

The place was freezing.  It was 48 outside and 65 inside.  I will give it that the building has a lot of windows that the tables are sitting up against but hey when you walk into Panera they have  a fireplace roaring.

Most of the prices are out of whack and the so-called ""ambassadors"" for it that I've experienced are either militant and mean about it or just plain weird.

So, I was skeptical when my wife wanted to visit this place with the kids. I figured that it would be expensive and there would be nothing that the kids would want here. I was surprised when we walked in the door that they have a Thomas the Tank Engine train table and the kids went right to work on that. After we ordered, my wife browsed around and looked at all the extra stuff they had for sale.

The sandwiches were just plain delicious. I had the southwest turkey, and the cheese was melted perfectly. The foccacia bread was chewy without being too dense, and my wife's wheat bread was crunchy, sweet and soft. The turkey tasted like they've been roasting a Thanksgiving bird all day and carved some off for us.

People are on here complaining about it not being fast. We got our food (3 sandwiches) within 10 minutes. If you want fast, you can go around the corner to Subway and watch them make your sandwich through the sneeze guard.

People are on here complaining about a lack of salads. If you want a salad, walk down to Eddie Met Salad. This is a bread company. Maybe you should have looked at the sign when you walked in.

People are on here complaining in general about the place just aren't giving it a fair shake. I think it probably has a lot to do with the usual lofty and unreasonable Carmel expectations, but the one problem I suppose they have with the location is that there are lots of office buildings in the area. The lunch crowd from those places does tend to get belligerent. Go to Mickey D's if you can't wait 10 minutes for your food.

Bottom line... I think if you like Panera or Paradise, then you will forget about them when you come to Great Harvest. Support a local business instead of a chain. Support a place that's doing it right with good, natural food instead of pink slime in a cardboard box. Support a place that is, above all, delicious and non-pretentious, which is something I think that Carmel could use a lot more of.",3.0493333333333337,5.0,positive,15

I ordered lunch today from the Carmel location. An older woman, whom I suspect is a new employee, placed my order. She needed help from a coworker in placing the order, which is why I think she might be new. The total came to $10.83 for my Mediterenean sandwich (turkey added) and chips. I'm from Chicago and I'm definitely not a cheapskate, but the total was higher than I imagined.

When I  read the paper menu (located by the door) the price states $6.95. But as the older woman pointed out, the printed menu is old and I should reference the menu board with the updated price of $7.95 (plus a dollar for the turkey). Ooookay, fine. I told her it might be a good idea to recycle the old menus if the information is incorrect. She didn't seem impressed with my suggestion.

When I returned to the office I was telling my colleague that I was a bit surprised at the price of a sandwich at Great Harvest. She asked to see the sandwich, so I unwrapped it, only to discover  1/2 a sandwich. 

I called the Carmel store and spoke to Charlie, who is apparently one of the managers. Charlie said that I could return to the store to get the other half. I told her that I couldn't do that because I have a meeting in ten minutes. She didn't offer any other suggestions, which is when I had to start providing suggestions for her, one of which was refunding my money. I realized then that she at no point apologized for the inconvenience and I called her on it. Instead of saying she apologizes she immediately went on the defense saying that she didn't take my order she just made the sandwich. 

Does it matter??? If someone is answering the phone and is a Manager, then it's common practice to acknowledge your customer's complaint and apologize. 

Though she was reluctant to give me a refund on the sandwich, she took my credit card information and said she would offer me a refund on the sandwich only (not the chips). Fine.

 Sounds like a bit of customer service training might help you from losing other customers. I for one would never come back.

Their wine bar is not open yet but the atmosphere was really thoughtout - terrazzo floors and a cozy feeling. Great place to open a bottle with some friends whenever that will be safe again.

You can go to a bar or restaurant, get a glass of wine and love it but you know better than to buy a bottle there bc of mark-up. Well at CM, you can taste a glass and buy a bottle right there without restaurant markup.

I love that they curate organic, biodynamic, natural, lo-fi, eco-friendly wines! Bonus: they are actually affordable! If you love affordable wine (im looking at you Barefoot wine person) but don't want to have a headache from bad wine, then I recommend you get your wine here.

The owners are 2 guys with lots of knowledge and experience with pretty much all facets of wine from making it to suggesting based on your likes and they are really good at it!  

This is a shop so anything you are drinking and like you can buy and I suggest that after you taste something and you like it, buy the bottle.  There is a really good chance it is extremely reasonably priced and you can get the bottle for probably the price of 2 glasses.

The concept is so simple-warehouse style pricing on natural wine. Genius. 

The owners are incredibly hands on and trustworthy. They will talk you through every bottle in the shop if you ask (although don't be that guy). Cory has an amazing gift in describing wine and also and maybe more importantly-talking to you like you're ""on his level"" even though he and you both know you are far from it. I dunno man, that's a real gift. It's rare that you can share a conversation with someone and feel like you really learned something without having to feel like a noob. 

The shipments come in multiple times a week. So the stock is always changing. They do discounts when you purchase 5 bottles at a time. 

The attached bar is it's own little perfect gem. It probably deserves a review of its own in fact. There's no menu, it's just what's open that day. BUT obviously they will open anything in the shop for ya. The $10 corkage seems high at first until you remember how fairly priced the bottles are.

In the back is a quaint little wine room. There's no menu - you just tell the bartender what you like and he sources one for you. I have no clue what I drank, other than it was red and bubbly, but I liked it! My bf said his Bordeaux was ok but he wouldn't get it again. 

Cute concept and you can bring in charcuterie and cheese from a shop across the street. The bottles are all around $20 each but a glass is about $10. Yikes. Two glasses cost us the same as a bottle, and they were average pour sizes, not overly generous.

And the sandwich loaf is a slightly sour version of Wonderbread, except the flavor's been perfected with the fermented dough. I made the best grilled cheese and french toast ever with the sandwich loaf. It's really astounding how much flavor simple bread can have!

Who know sourdough could taste this amazing.
I was a believer when I took my first bite out of Philly Bread's baguette. In general, the baguette is humble and simple. There are no extra flavors to hide imperfections in texture, so for me this is a true test to determine if a bread is remarkable or just run of the mill. The baguette from Philly Bread has a crunchy crust that crackles as you break into it. The inside is light and airy. The shape is unfussy and rustic. The sourdough favor comes through ever so slightly so the bread still feels substantial and satisfying. Try having this warm and fresh out the oven- you too will fall in love with Philly Bread.

Also notable are the bagels. They have a great texture and shape, taste delicious both fresh and toasted, and also freeze really well. The seasoning for the Everything Bagel is spot on and you can actually smell the garlic, showing how fresh and high quality all the ingredients are.

Lastly, Pete, the brains and soul behind Philly Bread is truly a creative genius. He takes the time to understand the chemical process behind the fermentation and baking and is happy to share his knowledge.

Upon reaching SanSai, we discovered a lengthy line out the door. Hmmm, maybe this place isn't as bad as the other metro area locations? 

Wrong. 

It's just as bad. Or maybe I should say bad, but just as fast foody. No, not really fast foody, it's like Chinese places in airports -- they sound better than ""true"" fast food, but they end up being overpriced not all that satisfying. 

The two of us shared: 

Spicy tuna roll (yes, I know others said to avoid the sushi): I'm curious what this cut of tuna looked like before being rolled. There were a couple of pieces where the tuna took up it's normal portion of the roll, other pieces it was minuscule. And there's about an inch of rice around these puppies. The crunch of the veggies helped, but not much. 

Oriental salad: It tasted fresh, but the alleged ""honey mustard vinaigrette"" apparently made on cameo appearances. And when it did, it had a strange chemical/metallic aftertaste. 

Dumpling soup: The dumplings weren't bad, but the broth? Again, for another location, it was mentioned that the broth tastes watered down. After eating the dumplings, the remainder of the soup was just bad. This is what they fed Andy Dufresne when he was in the hole. 

Potstickers: hey, it's the same dumplings, just fried! But I had to have them, I mean, you can't be in a place like this without something fried. 

I was hoping to be surprised in a ""oh it's not that bad"" way. Instead, I walked away saying ""yeah, it really is.""

I've had the sushi here a few times and it is on par with the grocery store as far as quality.

Ask any sushi chef what the key ingredient is and they'll always say perfectly made rice.

I got the special sushi combo, which comes with a salad and miso soup.  I picked the cucumber seaweed salad, which uses the flat, dark green pieces of seaweed instead of the translucent greenish yellow seaweed as I assumed it would.  It's the same seaweed you use in miso soup, so I'm seeing where they're cutting corners.

After 25 minutes waiting and seeing that my colleagues and three customers that had ordered after me had received their meals, I asked the cashier about my order. The cashier checked with one of the ""cooks"" and then told it would just be another 5 minutes. So I wait.

I waited about 8 minutes before checking again on my meal. My food was STILL not ready, so after waiting another 5 minutes and seeing that my colleagues were nearly done eating their meals, I told the cashier that I will need to take a refund if my food is still not ready. The cashier replies ""Oh OK"", then takes my receipt and moves to her register. She then begins talking with another customer. I ask about the refund again, then wait another 5 minutes so that she can get another worker to give me the refund. There was never an apology... No ""sorry for your wait"". I paid for food and just expected the food I paid for and the workers acted as if I was bothering them. I have worked many customer service jobs and I know how respected restaurants should run and this is not it! 

Needless to say, I will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone based on my experience and will not return to this location.

This was everything I would have hoped for with a generous display of cajun sauce beneath a bed of spaghetti noodels with huge shrimp, sausage and yes turkey. The turkey was a bit odd but worked in this dish. I loved every bite but couldn't eat it all. 

As I watched what people were ordering, I saw that the portions were huge for just about anything that came out of the kitchen. 

I drank iced tea with my meal and finished it with a cup of coffee. The total with gratuity came to $29. That is quite reasonable for very good food. This beats the hard rock cafe inside hands down, so try out this little gem. It is further back inside the casino, but it was well worth the walk.",2.7414285714285715,2.9800000000000004,neutral,14

So instead, I ordered the chocolate cake and made it a la mode. Delicious! Great way to spend my little winnings from the casino. ha.

Although, our service was a little slow, especially just for cake. I didn't mind too much only because I was people watching the table service for another party. Apparently, the woman ordered her steak medium. She had to send it back because it was overcooked. The second steak came out STILL overcooked. Terrible and unacceptable! (on the chef's part) But what surprised me was how great the server was about it. He thought it was ridiculous that it came out wrong TWICE and really wanted to make things right.

Even when we decided to pay for it using all three of our rewards cards points she had no problem setting it up. Made some good meal suggestions too.

The menu ranges from basic diner food offerings with flair to some eclectic dishes. Some comfort food to healthy choices too. I ended up ordering the grilled grouper fish sandwich which came open faced on a bun (which I discarded) and was able to substitute a fruit bowl for a side instead of fries. No problem at all, and it was pretty tasty.

There were about 20 tables inside. 

Our server, Jiman, was friendly and attentive as we worked our way through the menu.  He brought us water with lime and complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was hot and spicy and woke up my tastebuds. 

We ordered a chicken and a steak taco each. And also an order of sweet corn tamales. The food came out quickly and hot. The traditional street tacos were served with meat and topped with onions and fresh cilantro and served with large juicy lime wedges. The roasted chicken was juicy and flavorful. The steak taco was good as well. Both were served on white corn tortillas. The tacos were excellent....and filling. 

The sweet corn tamales were (no kidding) sweet like a dessert. They were served hot. There was no filling but the tamale was rich with corn. Sour cream was included for dipping. The tamales were not traditionally what I expected but excellent. I will dream about those tamales. You must try at least once. 

They serve beer and drinks but we did not try. They have a full menu of interesting options including breakfast.  Prices range from inexpensive to higher.

Walked in to Yordana II tonight for a light bite and went with a slice of regular pizza that was sitting under glass. The place was empty but for me at 7:15. It had about a half dozen booths along the inside wall.  It was a clean house, with three guys in the kitchen. Everyone was polite. 

I asked that the reheat be ""well done,"" to bring the wedge fully back to life. The young cashier took my $4 and handed me some change for the tip jar on the counter. I went to pour my drink and retreated to a booth to await my victuals. 

It arrived a few minutes later in the hands of the chef. It was a smallish slice, but I wasn't starving. My standard for good pizza wants the point to stand firm when picked up by the crust. It demonstrates a well baked and strong chassis upon which the rest of the vehicle is built. This one collapsed on elevation. The weight of the cheese and the trapped moisture in the underbaked bottom made for a soggy base. 

I folded it over longitudinally to hold it together, and a rivulet of oil rolled off onto the paper plate. Cheap cheese. When I could finally take the first bite, the triangle was hot enough to melt the surface and warm the undercarriage, but had not reached full reheat, let alone the heavier burn I requested. Also, the top was almost entirely cheese with a thin tasteless layer of sauce. Bad proportions. 

This was not a good pizza for me. Everyone has a different preference for their pie, but when requests are not honored, the problem goes deeper than lack of real experience with a classic American comfort food. It is about listening and translating that request into the desired product. This just wasn't done. 

Everything else on the menu may be great, but the pizza reheat was not.",3.127333333333333,1.3199999999999998,negative,15

Well, if we could all agree on a pizza place the next step are the meals.  I was so excited.  We never agree on what to eat or where to get the food.   We started ordering hamburgers and then went on to meals.  I will tell you that they make the BEST Chicken Francaise I ever ate.  I asked them to put in a little more lemon and WOW was it delicious.   I am hooked.  We probably order 4 times a week from them.  They are really delicious and very affordable.

So today was the second day I ordered for Yordana's. 

I searched yelp for a good salad and found Yordanas Aztec Salad! Blackened shrimp and chicken over mixed greens with tomatoes, corn, pepperjack and cheddar cheeses. Peppercorn ranch dressing and a triangle of garlic bread come with. 

I ordered the large version of the salad that came to about $14 with delivery. It arrived fairly quickly and looked great... (please note that this is the beginning of my TWO STAR review). It tasted good but got incredibly salty after adding about a tablespoon of dressing to the ingredients. It was large enough to eat over two sittings. 

The very next day I ordered a small version of the same (to give to my mother) and the Mediterranean salad, $3 extra of added grilled chicken. The total came to $22 with a 10% added via Eat24. 

The second Salad came in a different container than the first, one a plastic clam shell and the other a removable top. No issue there. The chicken on the second was plentiful and appeared to be grilled thoroughly and seasoned well. I looked forward to eating it.

BUT THE AZTEC SALAD ALREADY HAD DRESSING ON THE LEAVES! WTF! 

I just ordered this salad yesterday. It came dry and I ate a great much of it that way before I even added dressing so this was off. And whatever was on the leaves was creamy in color so it wasn't ""sweat"" from the warm protein. I don't want to assume anything terrible - like perhaps someone pulled a Friendly's  and just swapped containers from someone else's meal - but I couldn't eat it. I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I've considered many options about the temperature inside the container making it wilt the lettuce but nothing justifies the color of the liquid and it's abundance. It's completely drenched in this ""sauce""

The other salad looks fine but I won't be eating that either. And I probably won't return to Yordana's.",3.127333333333333,1.2000000000000002,negative,15

I go back a few weeks later assuming the Baskin Robins in the DD would be different, I was wrong. My milkshake was literally flavored milk. It was completely liquid and Luke warm. Like they made it with hot milk.

I really did. I love the concept...sit-down restaurant quality burgers done fast with a fresh topping bar so you can dress your burger any way you want. Unfortunately the focus only seems to be on quickness

First off, you must know that the people behind Cheeseburger Charley's were the same people that started O'Charley's. Say what you will about O'Charley's, no restaurant chain has that level of success without doing SOMETHING right. I guess what I'm trying to get at is that the concept is solid. The execution was lacking.

I ordered the 'beefalo' burger, which is what I understand to be female buffalo bred to 'normal' bovine bulls. It is supposed to be leaner than regular ground beef, but not as gamey or lean as straight ground buffalo. I'd never had 'beefalo' before, so I was excited. Unfortunately, leaner only meant dry. I was able to watch the burger being cooked, so I have a fair amount of insight as to why. First, the grill cook pressed the absolute hell out of the burger with the spatula. Yes, doing this cooks the burger faster, but sacrifices all the delicious beefy juices that make the burger great. Second, instead of using the insulating dome alone to melt the cheese, the grill cook used it to further speed the cooking process, squirting water underneath the dome to create steam that speeds cooking, at the cost of ever more flavor as the water draws out the moisture and salt from the burger patty. What could have been an excellent burger was rendered near-inedible by a grill cook who obviously cared not about the taste and only about the speed of preparation. My wife's 'normal' ground beef mushroom and swiss burger was treated in the same manner, but the higher fat content of her burger meant that it was at least edible, but in all honesty, it was still pretty dry. 

In short, the concept is great, but the execution needs some work. The cooks need to take pride in the taste of their food instead of sacrificing it for a quicker ticket time.",2.7126666666666663,1.0,negative,15

I decided to walk on the wild side and give theirs a try since I was passing it anyways on the ride home from Radnor. This was probably one of the better decisions I made that afternoon. haha. It was insanely delicious! 

I ordered the black bean burger sans cheese on wheat. I dressed it myself (which is a def perk of CC's) with tomatoes, leafy greens, sprouts and pickles. It was THE perfect texture (I like mine a tad crunchy on the edges), full of flavor and for under 8 dollars it came with Baked Lays and a drink.

The tomatoes were August ripe, just the right amount of lettuce, and onions.  The dressing must have been made with finest olive oil.  I ate it voraciously. 
I'm glad I passed on the ""wrap"" option because the roll was outstanding.  Different, but outstanding.

Dom suggested to have the steak and cheeses separate from the rolls. This was a great idea, and very accommodating to those with allergies!

Our family party was an all day/night thing, so we needed both lunch and dinner provided. They brought everything that morning, but had it separated for each meal, which worked out perfectly. All we had to do was briefly heat up the dinner trays before adding them to the chafing stands. Many of our guests were from out of town, but grew up in this area. They were thrilled to be enjoying foods they remember but can't get where they live, like scrapple, cheesesteaks and soft pretzels.

I guess they don't care about taking people's money without delivering them their food. Oh well, I guess I can just keep going elsewhere. No big deal, their dough has no flavor and the sauce is bland. Their veggies are ok, but that's about it.

Wow, worse than the previous time - if that's possible. Ordered a pizza with 5 toppings and it looked like a lightly-sauced circle of bread. Unbelievable how weak this pizza was.

I disagree with a previous one-star review that states this is in a ""bad area of town."" It's not. It's certainly not the Catalina Foothills, but I feel totally safe at this Neighborhood Market. The parking lot is well-lit at night and it is near a major intersection with many businesses on both sides of the street. I personally did not see a parking lot or store ""full of addicts, vagrants, and homeless people."" I just saw regular customers shopping. The clientele did not look any different than at the Fry's Grocery up the street. I am not disputing the reviewer's experience, I'm just saying that has not been my experience in my visits here.

The one thing that is annoying to me is that some items are not consistent across the board in Walmart Corporation. What you see at the Walmart Superstore grocery section may not be at the Neighborhood Market in your area or where you work. So if you see something that you want, I advise that you get it because it might not be at the next Walmart grocery store. This applies mostly to special items, not your mainstream items.

I only wish that this store was just a tad more brighter inside. It's not dark, but it is not as bright as the other grocery stores.

Large stock of alcohol, although you have to press a button to request help with unlocking it. Not sure how long that would take.

I told him what had just occurred & he offered to go back & get the Mgr.  The Mgr. never came up front.  After 5-10 mins. the same young man went back a second time to get the Mgr.  The Mgr. didn't come out that time either.  Finally, after waiting at least 15 mins.+, the girl who was the checker on break, came out.  After I got home, I called Customer Service to complain & the young lady who answered the phone said she would have her Mgr. call me.  Guess what, that Mgr. didn't call me.  I have NOT been back since.  I worked from age 14 to age 66, as well as being educated for 16+ years; and, Customer Service was always drilled into employees, wherever I worked for 52 years.  This particular Walmart Neighborhood Market's Customer Service ""sucks""!  The Walmart Corporate Office needs to fire whoever these Managers were & replace them with employees who truly know how to provide ""Excellent Customer Service"".  Lastly, I think the young man with the ""Conan"" hairdo and the cocky attitude, needs to be fired also.

The most positive part of the experience as a patient with multiple chronic illnesses where I am here constantly, is the people behind the counter in the pharmacy.  They know me, they take care of me, as a human suffering at the hand of life-altering medical conditions, to those that actually care about me here, I am not just another number, and that MATTERS.  When you're around doctors, nurses, technicians, and people in the medical field, you often get lost as just another patient in this world.  Few actually stand out and make a difference in my healthCARE.
Christina will know me even over the phone as soon as I mention my name, she's such a sweetheart, she tries her best to help me out, and we even chat about our lives since I am there all the time.  
Nancy has also been an angel in helping me with my complicated prescriptions, doctors, paperwork, and insurance hoops we have to jump through to get me the care I need, all the girls I mention here have been helpful, as it was initially a horrid, tearful mess trying to establish my care here after moving down to this area from our of state.  There is another manager-type/head pharmacist who helps out these other ladies when they have questions, she is a shorter blonde lady, and I am pretty sure she knows me well too, she is great.  There have been many complications with insurances, and co-pay cards and they do their best to help get me the best care.
Recently, the late evening shifts, we have encountered the opposite.  Which just makes the whole long-waiting situation more excruciating for everyone.  There was an African-American woman with incredibly long hair tonight who was quite rude through the drive thru late Sunday night, but her name badge around her neck was flipped around.  It just made an already difficult day, more challenging.
There also has been a matter of clerical error with billing where I have been charged a significant amount MORE than was supposed to be, and they have assured me multiple times they're looking into it, and there is nothing more I can do, but it has made no progress, so I fear they are just saying it to placate me.  
Also, more often than not, there is a severe lack of help for customers, resulting in very long lines, extensive wait-times, very frantic & stressed out pharmacists, technicians, and anyone behind the counter as they attempt to make a dent in helping the multitude of irritated, impatient customers.  They need to hire more to work in this department.  I have been going to Walgreens for several years and fear the need to change to CVS or a different store if we keep experiencing these constant issues.
Please, hire more people in the pharmacy, and fix whatever telephone issue is happening because when I call I get disconnected frequently, and a lot of the time I get transferred, someone picks up the line and immediately hangs up.  That is just plain rude.",3.0764285714285715,2.16,neutral,14

It was obvious at about every touch point that this restaurant positioned itself as gourmet.   Unfortunately, this created several expectations that were not met.

The most frustrating thing about our visit was the awkwardness of the service and staff.  My wife and I arrived ahead of the rest of  our party and we were immediately approached and asked if we would be paying on one or multiple checks.  We ordered appetizers for the table, but we're given no guidance (we ordered ravioli fritti to share for ten people... they brought out a plate of three small ravioli!).  At multiple points through the meal, the wait staff would remove our plates, even though we were still working on the food!  We ordered a couple bottles of wine to share, but as they filled our glasses, they often spilled the wine on the table, on our plates, and at one point, even on my arm.  I understand mistakes, but none of these were acknowledged.

The food quality was average, definitely not gourmet like the .  Ok for the price, but definitely didn't live up to the gourmet billing.  I ordered a seafood pasta, but the scallops were overcooked and chewy and the shrimp had a less-than-fresh, fishy taste.  My wife ordered a risotto dish, but described it as overcooked and oversalted.  I enjoyed the tiramisu quite a bit though.

All of this said, we were a ""difficult party"": 10 individuals, 2 elderly with hearing loss, two youngsters under 10, and an infant in a car seat.

Very very slow service. Hardly edible food. Here's my recent experience that I consider the last straw that pushed me to a review.......

Pull in drive thru and ordered two plain burgers and fries, told them no cheese at speaker, again at both windows (I'm lactose intolerant and I made that clear as well) ten minutes to get to the first window then sat there for a few more while the girl at the window finished her texts, assured me it would be how I ordered it. Could hardly hear her over the employees blasting music. Get my order after 15 min and it has cheese! (How hard is it to NOT put condiments on a burger!?!? Like seriously????)

I then proceed to the dining room to correct my order, get hassled and told to be specific in which I thought telling them 5 times was pretty specific in my opinion. Took another 6 minutes to cook my burgers right while waiting with 4 other customers in there for screwed up orders via drive thru. I finally get my order after 20+ minutes.....and the fries are missing. Told them I want my fries I paid for and the manager told me it would be another few minutes since they had no fries cooked! Eventually she brings my fries (half cooked) and dumps them upside down in my bag (mind you this ""manager"" was wearing a t shirt and sweat pants with no name tag) I say thanks and have a good night, she calls me a dick as I'm walking out the door. Took 38 minutes total to get my order. 

Moral of the story: employees either need fired or retrained, there is no excuse for this. this happens quite often. I order plain burgers without cheese and not one McDonalds location around here can EVER get it right but this location is by far the worst I have ever experienced, Richardson is a close second.

The presentation is NOT a typical traditional Indian dishes that you've seems at many Indian restaurants in town yet they still maintain the masala flavour in each foods we ordered.  Foods were fresh and tasty.

We started with Galouti Kebab.  It's not a conventional kebab on a skewer. It's more like meat patty. The smoky aroma of ground lamb meat went really well with Potli masala that was mixed inside the kebab. The meat patties were served on top of baby naan. The mint chutney was elevating the flavour of this Kebab. Beet and carrot curls that are used for garnishes had smoky flavour as well. 

With a copper brass bowl and warmer to serve Rogan Josh, it brought the dish looked classy.  The goat was cooked in Kashmiri spices, garam masala and saffron. We requested to have very spicy and the chef was fulfill the order as we saw chopped of green chilies to increase the heat level.

The flavour of spices in Rogan Josh was really great. Although the goat wasn't as soft as we expected, the dish was still great. We finished the meat and gravy by   mopping it with our naan.


The chef came to our table to offer their speciality dessert but we were too full.

After the meal, we suggested to have goat cooked little bit longer to soften the meat.",4.0473333333333334,3.6399999999999997,neutral,15

The food is delicious and you can immediately tell that the kitchen takes the extra effort to create authentic Indian dishes. Case in point was the insanely delicious coconut naan bread which has shredded coconut inside the bread, something I have never seen at any other Indian restaurant in town. In addition to the delicious taste, the presentation is superb and adds to the overall authentic atmosphere 

Service is also top notch. We were guided towards some items such as the milkshake (delicious) that would have otherwise not tried. The chef came out to chat and everyone was tremendously friendly. Food came out in a good time and everything was done with high professionalism

This place is unreal. I knew it would be great, but did I know it was going to blow my mind - no. I wasn't prepared for this kind of deliciousness. 

We were greeted at the door, which was so nice! We love a great smile and warm welcome!

We tried all the food. Just kidding, but we did try a lot. We had the Hara Bhara Samosas, Aloo Ghobi, Paneer Butter Masala, Honey Garlic and Coconut Naan, Pistachio Kulfi and two Pista Milkshakes. Everything was delicious. It is worth it to come in for the presentation alone, very visually appealing. We came very hungry and we basically ate everything. They had to roll us out in wheelbarrows afterwards. 

The star of the show for me by far was the Coconut Naan. This isn't something where they say that it's ""coconut"" flavour (and then it doesn't even taste like coconut), this is ACTUAL COCONUT IN NAAN. I was in utter heaven. This is something I've never tried before in my life. I could eat like 10 plates of this naan. This is the only naan I will ever need again in my life. 

My Dad is Goan, so I've tried a lot of Indian foods and restaurants in my life. This, however, was the ultimate. I would bring my Dad and Father-in-Law in here any day and they would die of happiness. I can't wait to show all my friends this amazing gem of a restaurant.

Additionally, the prices are reasonable, and they have specials that they run! Staff is friendly and attentive, with suggestions on what to try and always checking up on us. Alisha took great care of us the entire night! Chef Rahul also came and introduced himself in person, to see if we liked the food. Believe me, we did.

It was fantastic.

The restaurant is one of the only non-chain spots in a big box shopping area in east Edmonton. It doesn't look like much from the outside but inside in well decorated and comfortable.

While I wanted to try everything, we settled on two vegetarian dishes: the vegetable biryani and the palak paneer. I've never had biryani before so I have nothing to compare this to but I will say, this is one of the tastiest dishes I've ever had. The mix of flavours, textures and spices made me want to keep eating even when I was so so full. As for the palak paneer? I've had this dish many times before and this was one of the best. It was SO flavourful and the paneer was perfectly chewy.

I honestly just had to write this review because their veggie biryani is not only rich in flavour and packed with a variety of vegetables, crispy onions, and soy chunks but the dish is baked and beautifully presented with a layer of warm, tasty paratha-like bread covering it.

A few of the dishes I tried:

Yukon Gold Patties - these are vegetarian. I thought they were awesome
Chicken Vindaloo - easily the best thing I've tried there. I would definitely recommend this dish. It is spicy like most dishes but still really amazing.
Butter Chicken - the old faithful. It's amazing here as I thought it would be.

Located in Shopping complex across Superstore just off 17th street and Whitemud. Easy to get to with a lot of parking.

Event was a great treat taking us on a culinary experience to taste of tradional Indian Cuisines. Plated beautifully for the event, however served in pretty tiffin on a regular basis. Sit in, take out or even sign up for catering, Empire Grill does it all. 

Three course meal was full of spice and took your palate on a delicious adventure.

Chicken kabab was first served up as an appy on a bed of salad with green chutney drizzled all over. Definitely was spicy but tasty. Next came the main, a modern take on the traditional butter chicken, with the chicken served whole and cooked veggies on the side. Either way, cannot go wrong with butter chicken. Last but not least was my favorite- dessert- plated and served on dry ice to to add to adventurous tasty trip. 

Accompanied with  the meal was wine and beer supplied by Cork Beard and Wine Co. in which it was special to just cheer in the beginning of the holidays and celebrate the end of the year with other Elites!

It was a spritzy mango drink with cranberries and mint. It was super pretty and tasty! Shortly after, the appetizer rolled in - a generous portion of salad consisted of julienned vegetables with Reshmi Kebab meat. I started getting full, but then they brought out the main course. A huge plated butter chicken with vegetable sides and the Yukon Gold Patties. It was plated WAY cleaner and fancier than other Indian restaurants I had been to. The butter chicken was a WHOLE piece of juicy chicken breast rather than what I was used to (little cut up bits of chicken). It was served with garlic naan and when the naan ran out, the servers kept refilling tables with MORE NAAN! I LOVE MORE NAAN! Loved that we were also able to have some wine from Corkbeard as it paired really well with the fancy dinner. Finally, the super ICY COOL dessert (Ras Malai) came out and I loved it!

Kudos to Wendy's for proving someone could reach a higher pinnacle (or is that lower nadir?).

Arrived at the drive-through to order. No other car in sight. Nobody answers so we waited. Then my wife said ""hello"" and the girl's voice said ""hold on a minute"". 2-3 minutes later we got, ""what do you want?"" We ordered four meals. Wife ordered a Spicy Bacon Jalapeno Single meal. I ordered a Spicy Bacon Jalapeno chicken meal. The kids ordered fries and a frosty and chili and a lemonade.

They got the fries, frosty, chili and drinks right. Yay! Celebrate the little victories folks!!!!

After getting the food, she shut the window and walked off and we had to get her attention to get ketchup and mayonaise we had mentioned. I shoud have checked the bag very carefully at that moment? 

Despite taking about 14 minutes total in the drive-thru, the fries were soggy, limp and cold. My wife's burger had cheese, bacon lettuce and tomato and sauce, but no jalapenos. My chicken had a grilled patty, lettuce and sauce, no bacon, cheese or jalapenos. I estimate we overpaid by about $3.50 for what we did not get. 

If I had read reviews before hand, I would have opened every wrap and tested the fries before driving off.

Here is my final say about this: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice? Do you really think I am ever going to give them a chance to fool me again? :D

I have low expectations of fast food these days, but this was beyond the pale. By far the worst experience I have had in years, regardless of business types. If the owners have not figured this out, they need to read the reviews and think through their employees. If they have, the message is clear ""don't eat here"".",1.6546666666666667,1.0,negative,15

I wasn't but a few seconds and came in just as the guy behind me in line had finished with his transaction. I went to the cashier again and the woman behind me said ""Excuse me!"" as if I was cutting in line but I explained to her what had happened and she still moved in front of me. The cashier allowed this and I felt this was in a way discrimination because I was in line first, I had waited in line, and I'm a minority. The other customer was an older white woman. The cashier took her first and although I'm not as upset about being cut I am upset that I was not as valuable as the other woman and the cashier had the nerve to allow this discrimination.

We ordered 5 breadsticks and glad we did as they were large and cut in half so you got quite a bit and they automatically come with a small cup of nacho cheese and a marinara. We weren't very impressed by the breadsticks unfortunately and the cheese wasn't spicy like we like our nacho cheese. 

We also got a house salad with French which comes in a large styrofoam meal container topped with a ton of cheese, red onion slice, tomato slice, and cucumber. Very large salad which was also nice. 

We had it delivered. The delivery guy was very nice. He forgot the salad and rushed back to get it and bring it to us.

Had to look around to find a clean table. The old man, the owner's father I was told, was left alone and didn't know where the things were. He made me horrible scrambled eggs that went into the bagel. 

There were two men upset and loud at each other and I was afraid it could end up in a fist fight. So I left.

I won't be back or recommend this place.

Comfortable couches and chairs with traditional tables as well. Two very small but comfortable outdoor tables which is where I spent most of my visit. Lots of locals coming and going which is a sign of a good cup of coffee. As a non-coffee drinker I enjoyed a mango smoothe. I saw them make my drink with frozen mangos rather then some kind of concentrate. It wasn't overly sweet like some other places that make them from an unknown mixture. Perfectly blended and the service was friendly as well. Beautiful view of the flower shop across the street and our table was protected by an awning which made it fairly perfect when it started raining.

It also became a regular hangout for old perverts with nothing better to do than to gawk at young females passing by. Fast forward to present day: new locale, years later, I decided to give it another go last year. Interior is confused with mismatched furniture, making it feel cramped and uncomfortable. It feels chaotic almost. I reluctantly stay and order an iced soy latte. The milk was placed in a frother before being poured over ice. Iced lattes do not require froth or foam since it's made to be COLD, nor does it enhance the overall taste of the drink. As I took my first taste the bitterness of the espresso was too intense. The cold froth longer mattered; only the several dollars spent on a drink I could not swallow.

The Chickster, however, is not a good value at $7.50 for basic eggs and bacon.  You've got to do something more to get four stars.  In the end, the menu needs more choices to keep me interested.

A very good little breakfast/brunch place.  The omelets ingredients are unique and delicious.  I've had most of them and depending on your mood I think you can find just about any combination you want or make your own.

 i've never really been impressed by the arpotatoes, in fact, i was a bit disappointed, but being a side dish I didn't want to make it a focal point on this review.

  When I went I noticed several tables of women talking away.  This is that kind of breakfast place.  You can go and get comfy and talk to friends for awhile over a good meal.  

The wait staff has always been consistent and attentive.  

The cinnamon roll slice is very good in my opinion and I would considering ordering a whole cinnamon roll for my family. My daughter and I love them.  

Overall,  I think the prices here are fair for what you get. I recommend this restaurant if you want a sit down and chat kind of experience over a good omelet.




A few humble tips to the management:

I would really like to see this local restaurant supporting other locals.   I was disappointed to see a dainty mini basket of smuckers  standard blend of jellies.  I feel they should seek out local producers of APPLE BUTTER, honey, jellies, and jams (double bonus points if you actually sold jars of local stuff).  There are excellent choices in the Hendricks county area that i have purchased.  

Another review stated the Rye bread was the way to go...perhaps so as the wheat bread I was served seemed very much like any old off the shelf wheat bread.  I would seek out local bakeries and push their stuff or make it in house if you are daring.  Plus a few more breakfast baked options (I've never had your desserts but hear they are pretty good) 

The lame breads, stock jellies, and lackluster arpotatoes seemed so out of balance with the very good omelets that I've had there

Finally, I think this is the perfect place to offer a few more varieties of specialty teas.  (Triple bonus points if you can find and sell products from local tea producers, it's harder but they are out there)",3.061875,2.8200000000000003,neutral,16

Cinnamon Rooster has been around for 10 years and is open for breakfast and lunch only. 

The cinnamon rolls are buttery and delicious, not just sweet like at some places. One wedge is ample to split between 2 people. If I were told to choose between Patachou's cinnamon toast and Rooster's cinnamon roll...I'd pick the roll! 

The scrambled eggs are nice and fluffy, and the sausage gravy was ok but lacked spice. I like to put some cracked black pepper and red pepper flakes in mine...this one got all its flavor from the sausage. Last time I was here I had the quiche which was good and my friends got pancakes and the salmon omelet. Some of the items have goofy names...like ""Arpotatoes"" and ""Salmonchantment"".

I went on a very cold Sunday morning and the inside of the restaurant did not have the heat cranked up high enough to make it comfortable.

I did have pretty good service, but I noticed that you have to ask for water here because my waitress did not bring it automatically with my other drink order.

The hot chocolate was decent, and the presentation of it was actually sort of impressive with tall whip cream and Christmas colored sprinkles.

I ordered the Mexicalli omelet (spelled incorrectly on the menu), and it tasted OK, but again very average overall.

Okay, so I'd knock off points for the decor, but it IS called the Cinnamon Rooster. 

Instead, I'm taking off a half a point because they only put a few sugar packets on the table (they make these things called sugar dispensers or sugar shakers and they let sugar-a-holics like me fix their coffee just right without worrying they're hogging the sugar packers) and they use shelf-stable fake coffee creamers to pair with good, strong coffee. STAHP IT, NOW, PEOPLE! Those coffee creamers are loaded with chemicals - in fact, THEY CONTAIN NO CREAM AT ALL, and it's CHEAPER to buy bulk half and half! -1/2

And now on to the food...

From what you see here, the food appears decent, and some of it is, but here's the lowdown on what we had.

Bagel with cream cheese, provolone and bacon. The bagel was not toasted, then there was cream cheese spread across the bagel, chewy bacon (more on that in a minute) and a slice of provolone on top. Here's the point where you think ""ohhhh they're going to toast it and it will be divine.""  Nope. They MICROWAVED IT! -1 point

Biscuits and gravy: The gravy was nice and creamy, but almost as if it were prepackaged, not home cooked. And they used no salt or pepper in it, so you have to season it yourself. The biscuits appear to be homemade, but were incredibly dry and the top and bottom was hard. Decent flavor, but not worth returning for. -1/2

Hash browns: REALLY crunchy and greasy, mixed with green bell peppers. Yep, not sure about that, but I mixed it with my gravy to soften it up. -1

Eggs: They know how to make eggs, over easy was perfect and not a crunchy part in sight. +1

Bacon: From the looks of this nice center cut bacon you'd assume it would be good. Uh, wrong. One word: MICROWAVED. It was super chewy and a cryin' shame. That pig did not die to become crappy bacon to be shoved in a microwave. -1

Cinnamon roll: Okay, so they're known for their giant cinnamon rolls as big as your face. I just ordered a slice to go home. The waitress forgot to bring it (I assumed) and when I asked she said ""oh, it will be out in a second, WAIT FOR IT, WAIT FORRRR ITTTT, ""It's in the microwave."" FOR THE LOVE OF GOD... Microwaves have NO PLACE in a restaurant, get rid of it!!!!! I want a cinnamon roll that just came out of the oven, nice and gooey and delicious...not hard from being shoved in a microwave! -1

Update: I ate the microwaved re-microwaved cinnamon roll. It's just eh. Hard as a rock. And some strange flavor like oil or grease that I couldn't place. Perhaps I have a too-refined palate. Perhaps it's because my friends are educated chefs and I only know great food, I don't know. Okay, not likely, but I know a good cinnamon roll when I put it in my mouth and that's good enough! Now all I want is a damn Cinnabon. 

In a pinch, I suppose you could try it, but I'll save my $38 (yeah, it's overpriced, too), for TWO breakfasts at Charlie Brown's.",3.061875,1.0,negative,16

First, it's somewhat old and rundown which is fine, but almost everything in the store is dirty.  Much of the merchandise appears to be very old and dusty.  Aside from the dust, the old age is apparent with the products that are out of date.  It's very easy to find products well-beyond their expiration date throughout the store.

The floors aren't swept or mopped and most of the shelves are scantily stocked and disorderly.  Freezer items appear freezer-burned, and the pricing is extraordinarily high.  Selection is poor, at best.  The ""Oriental"" in the name of the store could easily be more appropriately be ""Korean"" as most selections available are Korean-specific.

I only stopped going so that I wouldn't get sick or bored with it. I LOVE THIS PLACE.

Parking: Can be an issue. It really all depends on what time you arrive. Sometimes I've had to park only as far as 3 blocks away, which isn't too bad. Then again the day of the week you go has everything to do with how easily you'll find parking.

Cover: Sometimes it's 5, sometimes it's 10. That's for females. I am unaware of cover is different for men. They do have security. They check your ID at the door, and pat-search you. A lady security officer takes care of the ladies. They wear a whole police looking uniform which can be slightly alarming when you first see it. Personally, i have never witnessed anyyhing go down in or outside of this bar. I always feel safe.

Seating: There are chairs at the bar. Plain and simple, get there EARLY if you'd prefer to be seated. Otherwise, you'll be standing the whole time.

Attire: definitely don't see a reason to come in here dressed like you're going to the club. Its a local bar, but some people see things differently. Something super casul, or semi casual should do it. Ladies are usually in flats, sneakers, or heels. 

Food: i usually don't eat when i go out, but one particular night, i was super hungry. So i ordered the turkey burger on the menu. OMG!It was literally the BEST turkey burger I'd had in my life. What surprised me and i honestly don't know why I'd never witnessed or thought of this myself, but they but turkey bacon on the turkey burger and it just blew my mind. I will say, as of lately, i believe they changed cooked. Last time i ordered this platter i wanted to cry. It was horrible. It went from being the best turkey burger, to the worst. I just picked the bacon off and left the burger... which was utterly and completely unseasoned along with the fries. I was severely disappointed. I have never ordered any other item off this menu.

Down to the nitty gritty!!!

Drinks: This establishment somehow has mastered to craft of making incredibly STRONG fishhbowls. I have had my share fair of fishbowls from many different places and they take the cake on this one. They have different flavor fishbowls, and they LOAD each one with gummy candies making it more enticing. I personally like the traditional blue fishbowls best, but the red ones are tolerable. ONE AND DONE. One of this bad boys always puts me in a tipsy daze. Most of the time i cant even finish the one I've ordered. A lot of people also like the alcoholic slush drinks. Not my cup of tea. Whenever I've tasted them, they are watered down due to the ice, I'd rather drink a fishbowl. 

**Drink Specials** if you get there before 12, fishlbowls are only $5 which is amazing considering they jump to $15 after. They also serve $2 until 12 along with other specials.

They have tvs and play sports that is muted unless there is something big going on.

Music: i greatly appreciate the music here. This is part of the reason i like it so much. They have a dj who just plays everything i want to hear. They strictly play rap and hip hop, you won't hear anything else.

Entertainment: They do have a pool table people play on. At 12 they fold it up to make more space.

Hookah: can't beat a $10 hookah. Only issue with this is, you can only order from the ""hookah person"" and its literally a cat and mouse chase to get their attention. Sometimes you will have to wait a long time before you are attended to. And they only have but so many hookah units. If they're out, you can't smoke hookah until someone abandons theirs. Sometimes they're just plain out of hookah.

I wish this place was bigger! When it gets packed, you can't move. Worst mistake they ever made was letting their bartender Mona leave. She was the BEST. Nice, and funny. Definitely a riot.",2.990769230769231,3.32,neutral,13

SEATING AREA
There are enough tables inside to dine in, but most people I saw were doing take out.

Parking can be limited as it shares spaces with other food businesses within the plaza. Recommend avoiding lunch time.

It had pieces of lychee, longan, red tapioca, jackfruit, green and white jello, pandas jelly, coconut and coconut milk.

Bambu is a franchised Che shop. Standard ""che"" is typically Che Ba Mau, comprised of coconut milk, shaved ice, jellies, and beans. However, Bambu is known for their large selection of different types of Che.

As I was not here for the special grand opening or soft opening, the wide assortment of items has been severely truncated, maybe even decreased more than 30% in offerings. There are only about 6 food items on the menu now, pho was removed as well as more traditional snacks. Only 2 types of banh mi: dac biet and thit nuong. Which were replaced with two types of goi cuon and just bun bo hue as the only soup. All shaved ice desserts were removed. This was sad, because after seeing photos of the menu on Yelp from before with many more options, I came here for lunch with just some rolls to choose from. However, the fried and nem neuong roll that I did try were delicious, but just not enough food for a meal.

The atmosphere is very trendy, dark, clean, and comfortable.

Yesterday, while in the Dunkin Donuts in Southampton (PA) I witnessed the employees play a special needs kid that was in there buying an iced coffee. They knew he had special needs and proceeded to mock him. As they were doing this, all 4 employees were laughing at this poor kid. Then they asked him if his name was ""Gay"" asking him if he liked girls. Absolutely sickening !!!!!! I was so mad I called corporate and they said they don't take this stuff lightly. I went in the store today to speak with the manager/owner and I was told there is no manager. I asked where the boys were that did the bullying and was told ""I don't know maybe they come in at 12"".

Not only is this despicable but I believe this store should be completely shut down.  How dare you make fun of a special needs individual let alone a paying customer.

Sepp's Pizza 
11053 86 Avenue

I went to Italy back in 2018. It was a life-changing experience. Before then, I hadn't travelled much. School, insufficient funds, parental tyranny, and insecurity consumed my life, resulting in the waste of my 20s.

I decided to take charge of my 30s. I travelled to Victoria to see DJ Premier, I went to a music festival in New York to see A Tribe Called Quest, and I spent my honeymoon in Italy.

Italy was a bucket-list item for me. The Pantheon, Duomo, Colosseum, and Uffizi Gallery were all selling points for my trip, but it was the food that excited me the most, especially the pizza.

After eating pizza in Italy, things were never the same. I began to despise the dumps like Pizza 73, Pizza Hut, and Panago for bastardizing Italy's godly creation. I also found myself on an arduous journey, unable to find something local that measured up to Italy's pizza.

Tony's Pizza Palace, our divine ruler of Italian cuisine, comes close to matching the best of Rome; however, their hardened crust has an undesirable crunch to it. 

Buco impersonates the lightness and almost captures the taste of Italian pizza. However, their charred pies have poor structural integrity, resulting in all the ingredients swiftly falling off as you pick up a slice.

My journey to find a local equivalent for the pizzas I devoured in Italy has been painful and unsuccessful. At times, I feel like Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now, searching for my Colonel Kurtz.

After about two years, I finally found my Colonel Kurtz at Sepp's Pizza. I told myself months ago that I'll never find anything local that measured up to the pizza in Rome, but I found it yesterday. 

Sepp's operates solely as a take-out and delivery joint. Next to their order window are scattered photographs of pop culture icons, including James Dean, Elvis Presley, and Clint Eastwood. The joint describes its pizza as New York style, with a northern twist; however, one bite of this pie brought back memories of Rome, including the Spanish Steps and the Dario Argento museum.

Everything about this pizza was fantastic. The mozzarella and red peppers were fresh and delicious. The generous distribution of large mushrooms - my second favourite pizza topping - complemented the piquant fennel sausage. And the dough maintained its structural composure as I viciously mangled it with my gnarled hands.

I also appreciated the thinness of the pie, which mimicked some of the pizzas I had in Rome. Although I've heard some great things about High Dough and their Detroit-style product, I've become partial to the thinner crust - it allows the toppings to shine and doesn't make you feel like a fat piece of crap after eating it. 

After finishing the entirety of the pie, I still felt light, and I was food-coma free. As a result, I decided to frolic in the playground and enjoyed me some little kid slides, bringing back memories of my 90s childhood and encouraging me to come home and watch Are You Afraid of the Dark - my favourite 90s show.

I wanted it to be amazing since I drove more than halfway across the city to pick it up. We ordered the Camrose Roni and the Pacific. The Pacific was my main choice as I love smoked salmon. This was going to be $60 which includes 4 cans of San Pellegrino and a tip along with the two pizzas. Well we get there and are told that because of some salmonella outbreak in the US, there were no red onions on the Pacific. Well anyone who's had a smoked salmon sandwich knows that red onions are an integral part of the flavour. A couple of things about this really aggravated me. First, why don't you go get some locally grown red onions? It's July...you can get red onions locally. Second, and I'm not trying to be ""that guy"" about it, but I added a 15% tip because restaurant folks work hard and I appreciate that. But they could have phoned and told me that 1/4 of the toppings on the pizza were not going to be on the pizza and at least give me a chance to change my order. That was kind of shitty. So, probably won't be back because of it. The Camrose Roni was pretty good, but I was pretty soured by the expert this.

I'm the type who likes to know about a person and they are actually from Jerusalem and didn't just use it for their name. 

The hummus is amazing. They do this up right! The salad is super fresh ingredients. The thoroughly enjoy the basmati rice with saffron. It's flavorful and fresh. I usually get the gyro plate and the portions are big and tasty. 

Above all else, they're friendly. This is hard to find these days. I'm very comfortable here and I definitely want to see them succeed. There was a mistake by the UberEATS driver. I'm not sure who she gave my food to but it wasn't me. Uber made it right and so did these guys even though it was NOT any fault of their own. 

I will continue to get my gyro and hummus fix here and encourage others to do the same. I hope your experience is as amazing a mine has been.",3.4423076923076925,4.24,positive,13

They skimp on everything. You have to ask for napkins. The bathroom looks and smells like hobos have been making love in there. The guy behind the counter was sheepish in a weird psycho-killer kind of way. He seemed a little confused as to why he was there. This place is a total freak show.,3.4423076923076925,2.36,neutral,13
