However, if your heart and health allows you to treat yourself with a 'lil fried goodies every now and then, Hyon's is the place to go. \n\nThey have a good selection of fried seafood and some fried chicken options (menu pictures posted). Food is made to order and platters are huge!! Also the price point is perfect and the kitchen seems clean! I can't say anything really bad about the place itself as I tried it and loved it. However, as you might notice, the neighborhood could be a little \"sketch\" time to time, which I find totally acceptable as you ll be there for 5 mins picking up your food.\n\nLastly, I haven't tried it myself but I can definitely see Hyon's as the place to order \"finger food\" for the occasional house party too!!!\n\n*Giving it a 4 star because of the location.

Even if you been REAL hungry.\n\n  That special comes with 6wings, golden nicely cooked fries, and your choice is of cole slaw or pasta salad. Think for $11+\n\n  So the prices definitely went up within the last 2yrs. Everything now is though cause of times so nothing big.\n\n  I enjoyed my wings honestly. Didn't finish them but they were satisfying and tasted decent.\n\n  Probably should've skipped on the crab sticks though but that was my fault cause I seen my cousin post some and I thought they would be good as his looked but they were just okay. Should've got the scallops like I originally was gonna do.\n\n  Called my order in ahead of time so it was no long time to get my food.  When you get there if you want condiments, you put them on yourself.\n\n  Everything is there so I put the ketchup, hot sauce, and little salt on both of my food.\n\n  Friendly staff inside. They speak and acknowledge you so that's always points for any business.\n\n  Have no complaints in general and yes I would come back, just would change my 2nd option.\n\n  Hyon's definitely worth a visit if your around the way.",

Don't be intimidated by Southern Comforts being in an everyday regular shopping center. The food is awesome. I'm from the South and can vouch for what I had at this restaurant. \n\nPlate 1: fried catfish with black eyed peas and collared greens. Every part of this was spot on. The catfish was huge, nice flaky white meat, and a seasoned light batter crust... not an over-battered, over fried piece of air you will find at other places. The BE peas had a savory flavor  and needed nothing... I would crush those on a regular basis. The greens were pretty good and Chef Rich gave me his own concoction of hot vinegar for those interested.\n\nPlate 2: Country Fried Steak (with creamy white gravy) with Mac n cheese and corn. It's nice to finally have CFS or \"Chicken fried steak\" offered from somewhere other than a diner. There are two delicious fried steaks. If you are looking for a hearty filling item, this is it. If you are unsure of what this is, give it a try if you like steak, burgers, fried chicken.... the Mac n cheese was a 3\/5 as I thought a little seasoning could bring up to a 4\/5. The corn was 3\/5 bc it was sweet and simple, but too basic of a side (my fault). Maybe adding a little pepper, or even diced peppers to contrast the sweet corn could spruce it up. \n\nOn another note, this is a great place where you will be supporting the \"Little guy\", the small business owner trying to perfect their craft and provide for the public.\n\nI am so happy to find a restaurant other than Dairy Queen that has white southern gravy. I wish the NE would realize it can be much better than brown gravy all the dang time. One thing I hope the chef adds to the menu is fried okra!\n\nThe restaurant is clean and comfy however due to covid it is takeout only. I would call in and ask Chef Rich when to show up. He will even call you back when it is ready if you like.\n\nI will be going back soon for sure",

Stick to traditional recipes, offer generous helpings and keep price within reason, and it will take off once Covid restrictions are in the rearview. \n\nIf my first exposure to their kitchen is any indication, they are on their way. They need to open their dining room to customers, and the rest is baked in. We ordered their \"Make Your Own\" dinners of 1) Country Fried Steak, roasted carrots & baked beans, and 2) Crab Cakes, bread stuffing, gravy and candied yams; with slice of carrot cake as shared dessert. It was all pretty darned good, except for the carrot cake. Allow me to elaborate. \n\nThe fried steak was a thin prefab ground patty, nicely fried and drowned in that white gravy. Nice texture and taste, with the gravy not too heavy on the tongue. The sides were a well made complement. Same with the crab cake. Crisp edges with crumbly crab with a little breading to bind them together, but with a dominant crustacean taste. We didn't use those little packages or tartar sauce, as there was enough flavor without them. The yams were sweet, but the bread stuffing was a bit dry and was not resuscitated by the gravy. Yet skipping the stuffing left a still very enjoyable meal. \n\nWord to the wise - Don't over sell a dessert that is past its prime. I was asked if I wanted dessert, and since it was brought to my attention, allowed myself to be upsold because I do love carrot cake as a general proposition. This wayward slice was the exception that proved the rule. It was smallish,  without much cake nor cream cheese icing. It was also noticeably dried out from too much shelf time. Definitely not the place to end a successful meal. It just wasn't worth the calories nor sugar kick. I don't mind being upsold when the product is worthwhile, but when it is a disappointment, it is self defeating. \n\nAlmost lost me there, but decided the rest of the meal was good enough to warrant partially overlooking that mistake. \n\n3.5 STARS",

Whenever I set foot into Fermenteria or Brew Cafe, I've always been enamored by the unique tshirts, hoodies, and glassware that I saw staring at me from the shelving and rafters. But in the busy restaurant and brewpub setting that almost always managed to become an afterthought for me.\n\nThat afterthought didn't happen to me as soon as I walked into the General Store, and came across t-shirts that I contemplated buying for OVER a year, coffee mugs alongside the Awake Minds coffee that Reanimator brews for them, ALL THE ARTISTIC GLASSWARE, and then some. So seeing all of those things brought to the forefront in this setting is obviously what the store is all about, and for that it definitely delivered a win.\n\nIf you've read my other reviews, followed my UnTappd checkins, or attended any of the the UYEs that I've hosted (5.0 coming in TBD 2018!), then you may know Tired Hands as a serious beer haven. But, while I may have seen a sampling of it when I looked upon their shelving and beer coolers, I also saw a lot to be desired compared to what I've indulged upon within either of their bars. True this may have been because I was there on Black Friday when every other beer store was winning out on Goose Island Bourbon Barrel Stouts. But still I expected to see more than their their standard beers like Hop Hands and Trendler Alt represented in their cans, and didn't see too many standout bottles this time around.\n\nBut still, with an ever changing lineup of forward thinking beers, and their main home brewery just a few blocks away, I expect to see this change upon other visits, and at least walk out with another bad ass t-shirt in the process.",

After calling it in, I drove there on my way home, and arrived just as it was coming out of the pressure fryer. It looked dark bronze and the odor of the steam being released went right to my head, and made me feel a bit intoxicated. \n\nNothing wrong with that!\n\nI watched as the cook removed the chicken and transferred it to an aluminum tray for safe travel. I counted the pieces with him, and think my package carried 17 total. I appreciated the extra generosity. He then wrapped the tray in foil, and tore open the top dome to allow the condensation to escape. In turn, that was placed in a heavy gauge brown paper sack, and again split open at the top for additional moisture release. \n\nBy the time I arrived home, I was nearly overcome by the aroma enveloping the car. I decided to sample a wing while still hot and wait for the family before consuming more. First bite encountered crisp skin, followed by warm white meat and a pleasant clean oil fried chicken flavor. I nibbled and sucked all the meat from them bones, and I selfishly considered grabbing a plump breast for a long moment. \n\nNah! It would be more fun to indulge with the fam. So, I waited. \n\nAn hour later we were sitting around the kitchen table with sides of homemade mashed potatoes and green salad as excellent complementary pieces to a very happy meal. \n\nA star is missing because truth be told, the chicken was a tad overdone. A lighter golden copper finish would have made it perfect. Turns out that as much as I love the color bronze, it is past prime when it comes to fried chicken excellence.
