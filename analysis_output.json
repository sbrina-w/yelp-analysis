Don't come here if you are on a diet or not a fan of fried food. However, if your heart and health allows you to treat yourself with a 'lil fried goodies every now and then, Hyon's is the place to go. \n\nThey have a good selection of fried seafood and some fried chicken options (menu pictures posted). Food is made to order and platters are huge!! Also the price point is perfect and the kitchen seems clean! I can't say anything really bad about the place itself as I tried it and loved it. However, as you might notice, the neighborhood could be a little \"sketch\" time to time, which I find totally acceptable as you ll be there for 5 mins picking up your food.\n\nLastly, I haven't tried it myself but I can definitely see Hyon's as the place to order \"finger food\" for the occasional house party too!!!\n\n*Giving it a 4 star because of the location. Food is just amazing.."

Hyon's has been around for years and years with two locations. This one amd the South Philly location. \n\nCheesesteaks, fries, onion rings and those damn breaded WINGS! I don't know what they bread them with at all and it annoys me lol kidding. But the wings are so crispy and light ! \n\nVery clean store and everyone wears gloves. \n\nHyon's is small\/storefront. Small bench to wait but this place gets crowded and fast. Employees are very friendly and attentive. They know their customer's orders as they walk in the door. You can order specials or platters from the menu or order things a la carte. They really do have some of the best wings in the city. \n\nNo online menu but I snagged a paper menu to start calling ahead of time."

I don't really care for seafood so i stick to the burgers, chicken fingers, and cheesesteaks. The only thing i don't like is that they bread their chicken.  I find that the chicken has no flavor and you really have to \"doctor it up\"!"

I mean the seafood is mushy at best while their famous fry batter is mediocre. The only thing that really hasn't lost its flavor or crunch would be the wings. Fair is fair and if I had to say if the was fair I would say \"HARDLY\". Dear Hyons please get rid of whomever is preparing what used to be your delicious food because brother it's the worst.\n\nSigned a very close neighbor"

The food was Great and the Staff was Friendly. They have the Best Breaded wings in the City Hands down."

Being from Southwest and hanging in West Philly a lot coming up as a kid, I always use to see this store but never ate from here until recently.\n\n  Tell you this much, the amount of food you receive in a chicken wing special is more than enough for one person in my opinion. Even if you been REAL hungry.\n\n  That special comes with 6wings, golden nicely cooked fries, and your choice is of cole slaw or pasta salad. Think for $11+\n\n  So the prices definitely went up within the last 2yrs. Everything now is though cause of times so nothing big.\n\n  I enjoyed my wings honestly. Didn't finish them but they were satisfying and tasted decent.\n\n  Probably should've skipped on the crab sticks though but that was my fault cause I seen my cousin post some and I thought they would be good as his looked but they were just okay. Should've got the scallops like I originally was gonna do.\n\n  Called my order in ahead of time so it was no long time to get my food.  When you get there if you want condiments, you put them on yourself.\n\n  Everything is there so I put the ketchup, hot sauce, and little salt on both of my food.\n\n  Friendly staff inside. They speak and acknowledge you so that's always points for any business.\n\n  Have no complaints in general and yes I would come back, just would change my 2nd option.\n\n  Hyon's definitely worth a visit if your around the way."
